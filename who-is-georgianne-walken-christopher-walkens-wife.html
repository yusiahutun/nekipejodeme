The moment their eyes met, he was lost. In his biography, “Christopher Walken A to Z: The Man, the Movies, the Legend,” he described her as “a fox.”</p><p>Author Robert Schnakenberg quoted Walken as saying: “She is a fox. We loved each other right away.”&nbsp;Georgianne greatly reciprocated his feelings, and not long after, they tied the knot in 1969.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lehhh-1.jpg><p>Their love story may have started like many others in Hollywood. However, it has unfolded uniquely and has stood the test of time.&nbsp;Christopher has been a steady screen fixture for decades, but his wife has been comparatively more private. Here’s what we know about her.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Georgianne_Walken_Biography></span>Georgianne Walken Biography&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Georgianne Leigh Korzen was born in Chicago, Illinois, on February 8, 1944. Her surname was changed to Thon to match her maternal aunt, Irene Thon, who brought her up. She made a name for herself as a casting director and owned Walken/Jaffe with her casting partner Sheila Jaffe.</p><p>Georgianne has worked on over 90 films and TV shows. Some of her best credits came from movies like “Entourage” and “The Sopranos.”&nbsp;She has been nominated for the Emmys eight times and has won the award once for her work on “The Sopranos” in 1999.</p><p>Aside from her work in the casting department, Georgianne also has some acting credits. She portrayed Wendy Abramson in the 1983 film “Brainstorm” and was featured in an episode of “The Sopranos.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Georgianne_Walken_Marriage></span>Georgianne Walken Marriage&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After the retired casting director and Christopher met in 1963, they started dating.&nbsp;At the time, Georgianne went by Georgianne Thon, but that changed after their marriage. They dated for six years after their initial meeting before they decided to walk down the aisle.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/leogh.jpg><p>They got married in January 1969 and have remained together ever since. These days, they shuttle between Connecticut and New York City as they have homes in both places. Christopher prefers their Connecticut home and described it as “much nicer” than their New York apartment.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Georgianne_Walken_Kids></span>Georgianne Walken Kids&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The former casting director has no children. This is because she is married to a man who has been very candid about his desire not to have kids.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with The Guardian in 2013, Georgianne’s husband revealed that his demanding career is part of why they chose not to start a family. Christopher believes that if he had become a father in the past, it would have hindered him from achieving the success he is now known for in Hollywood.&nbsp;</p><p>He <a href=#>said</a>: “I’m sure many of the kids I knew as a child would have continued in show business, but they had kids of their own and had to do something dependable. I didn’t, so I could get by even in periods of unemployment.”</p><p>In 2005, Christopher confessed that he had considered becoming a parent, but ultimately, it’s not who he is.&nbsp;</p><p>He <a href=#>said</a>, “I do like to work as much as I can because I don’t have children, I don’t have hobbies, I don’t do anything else. And I’m glad that I don’t have children.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Georgianne_Walken_Cats></span>Georgianne Walken Cats<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Instead of kids, Georgianne and her husband have taken a liking to furry companions. They share a cat named Bowtie, their second cat after losing Flapjack, another cat and their first pet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rrrgeor.jpg><p>Christopher enjoys peace with Georgianne and their cats at home when he is not busy on movie sets. Christopher said in 2016. “I make up different names for my cat all the time — Flapjack, Bowtie, Popcorn. But he’s really, ‘Hey you, cat.'”&nbsp;</p><p>In a July 2016 interview, Christopher confessed that he and Georgianne look at the cats as their kids.&nbsp;</p><p>He said: “My cats are extremely well taken care of. Frankly, if there’s such a thing as reincarnation, it would be wonderful to come back as my cat: Living where it lives, being taken care of by me and my wife — I’m not sure you could do better than that.”&nbsp;</p><p>Other stars like Christopher, who loves felines, include <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, Britney Spears, and Katy Perry.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZp%2BVpL%2BotcCnpZ5lp5a5rLHNZpqhqpmowbC8x56pZq%2BRobimutJmrqKelWQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./delores-winans.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Delores Winans - Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Facts, Nationality">&larr;

Despite the joyous occasion, there were reports of difficult conversations in the build-up to the big day.</strong> <strong>One royal author has claimed Harry and Meghan Markle had a ‘tantrum’. But the Queen gave a word of warning in return.</strong></p><p>Meghan, looking elegant and chic, became the ‘world’s favorite’ royal bride after millions tuned in to watch her say I Do to her very own Prince Charming. Google searches for wedding dresses exploded after she tied the knot with <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>, and it’s clear to see why. The pair marked a turning point for the <a href=#>royal family</a>. The British monarchy was finally pivoting to represent a modernized version of The Firm. Looking back at the special vows, the planning for the wedding actually included some uncomfortable moments, including one with the Queen herself. A royal author has written about the ordeal, including when Harry and <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> were accused of having a ‘tantrum’ over a tiara.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-tantrum-author-reveals>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ‘tantrum’ – author reveals</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-115223348-1024x683.jpg><p>Royal author Angela Levin, who <a href=# rel=nofollow>penned</a> Harry: Conversations with a Prince, explained the big day. She claims a tiara sparked an awkward chat about what Meghan Markle ‘wants’ and there were talks of a tantrum. But both from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.</p><p>So what happened?</p><p>Levin wrote: “Meghan’s sixteen-foot veil of silk tulle had been embroidered with the flora of the fifty-three Commonwealth nations. It was held in place by Queen Mary’s diamond bandeau tiara, with a detachable diamond brooch, made in 1932, in its center and lent to Meghan by the <a href=#>Queen</a>.</p><p>“Months later, royal watcher Robert Jobson disclosed in his book that there had been a heated exchange over which tiara Meghan would wear.</p><p>“She wanted the Vladimir tiara set with emeralds, but the stones may have been Russian, and she was told to choose a different one.</p><p>“Apparently Harry was incandescent that her choice was turned down, and both were accused of ‘temper tantrums’.</p><p>“The Queen allegedly told Harry: ‘Meghan cannot have whatever she wants. She gets what tiara she’s given by me.'”</p><p>Levin also said in her book: “Sources also claimed she wanted the chapel sprayed before her wedding to remove the musty odor. Her wish was not granted by Buckingham Palace, who stated that if the 600-year-old chapel was good enough for the Queen, it was good enough for her.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-s-stunning-wedding-look>Meghan’s stunning wedding look</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-960096284-1024x683.jpg><p>The Duchess looked radiant on the big day. She wore a pair of Cartier diamond stud earrings and diamond bracelet, said to be valued at $166,000. The 42-year-old is a big fan of the brand. She has long been seen wearing the designer jewelry on many occasions. She’s also not afraid to turn up in show-stopping <a href=#>fashion</a> looks. The mom-of-two recently appeared <a href=#>covered in $40k glam</a> for the Invictus Games over the summer.</p><p>Her hair was pulled back, with a few loose strands to frame her face. Nothing was going to top Meghan Markle’s wedding dress itself. A classic ‘$122,000’ gown designed by Clare Waight Keller. Keller, from Birmingham in the UK, was the first female artistic director of Givenchy.</p><p>The dress, made from white silk, had three-quarter sleeves and a bateau-shaped neckline. The Duchess paired the elegant gown with bridal satin shoes. She held a small bouquet made up of sweet peas, lily of the valley and forget-me-nots. The latter being <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>‘s favorite flower, which Harry himself picked from his own garden.</p><p>She also carried sprigs of myrtle from stems, planted by Queen Victoria in 1845, as well as those from a plant grown from myrtle that featured in Queen Elizabeth II’s own wedding bouquet in 1947. The <a href=#>Queen was married to Prince Philip</a> for more than seven decades. They had a long and fulfilling life together before their deaths.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bombshell-before-the-big-day>Bombshell before the big day</h2><p>Her father, <a href=#>Thomas Markle, and Meghan have a strained</a> relationship. Days before the wedding, he said he couldn’t attend. He says he needed surgery on his heart and wouldn’t be able to fly over to giver her away. Therefore, Meghan’s final walk as a single woman was different from originally planned.</p><p>Instead, she began her walk alone through the nave, where she met <a href=#>King Charles</a>. He took her arm in his, whispered a few words – likely of encouragement – and smiled as he escorted her towards the High Altar, where Harry was eagerly waiting.</p><p>Before reaching the Duke, he “discreetly” stepped back just before, to let Meghan walk up to Harry alone. Levin claims he knew she “didn’t want to be formally given away”. Although sources claimed, <a href=#>Meghan Markle was no blushing bride</a> over the sweet gesture.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2WGcL3UnpynZaSkuaV5z6ugp5uVYrWivtGyZKadl52ur3nCmqWtZZiWw6Z51qGYrZ2mmr9uv8eeZLCZnqnAbq3FrZyrZaSWu7W%2B1KZm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./trippie-redds-manager-charlene-bryant-peels-back-the-layers-of-fandom.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Trippie Redds Manager Charlene Bryant Peels Back The Layers Of Fandom">&larr;

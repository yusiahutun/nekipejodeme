Here’s why.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Mila Kunis is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood. The Ukrainian-born beauty has dazzled fans with her stunning looks since the beginning of her career.</p><p>She <a href=#>rose</a> to fame in the popular television series “That 70s Show.” She portrayed Jackie Burkhart, a spirited, chirpy, self-centered rich girl in the series.</p><p>The series propelled her into fame in the movie industry and led to other movie roles. Then, riding on the back of her performance in the series, Kunis landed a role on the animated sitcom “Family Guy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/52/9f/58/529f58c5c927e00551fc5cd2fc19d9c4.jpg><p>The actress showcased her talents by voicing the character “Meg Griffin.” Afterward, in 2001, she appeared in the movie “Get Over It” alongside actress Kristen Dunst.&nbsp;She was taking on different roles and performing well. As a result, she started getting noticed by producers, which led to more prominent movies and roles.</p><p>Throughout her career, Kunis has starred in a host of top-charting movies. Some of those movies include “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” in 2008. The actress starred as siren receptionist Rachel Jansen alongside top actors like Jason Segel and Russell Brand.</p><p>In 2009 she starred in “Extract” opposite Jason Bateman and Ben Affleck. Then “Book Of Eli” opposite Denzel Washington the following year. In 2010 we saw her as the dark Lily in “Black Swan.”</p><p>The movie featured Natalie Portman in the lead role and became one of Kunis’ top movies. Her performance earned her multiple award nominations.&nbsp;Some of her other top movies include: “Friends With Benefits” alongside Justin Timberlake, “Bad Moms” and the sequel “A Bad Moms Christmas,” and “The Spy Who Dumped Me.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=World_Sexiest_Woman></span><strong>World Sexiest Woman</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Besides her excellent acting skills, Kunis is also very popular among fans due to her beauty. She is the face of Dior and, in 2013, was voted the sexiest woman in the world in the annual FHM 100 sexiest women poll.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/07/ad/f4/07adf4bb3765586445d57dddd39c112e.jpg><p>Afterward, Kunis became the first American actress to top the poll in four years. She won the crown from singer Tulisa Contostavlos. The previous winners include British model Rosie Huntington-Whitely and singer Cheryl Cole.</p><p>The actress defeated other favorites, including Rihanna and Helen Flanagan. Speaking about Kunis winning the pool Dan Jude from FHM <a href=#>said</a>:</p><p><strong>“Not only is she naturally stunning, but she has a great sense of humour and isn’t afraid to poke fun at herself.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kunis_Signature_Look></span><strong>Kunis’ Signature Look</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Celebrities over the years have mastered something that individually sets themselves apart from the rest. Sometimes, it’s a costume like musical duo Daft Punk or an iconic ‘smoky eye’ look in Kunis’ case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/13/0d/21/130d21a97509efeb662574bf7ee09370.jpg><p>The actress has stayed loyal to her defining look for over a decade. Although she has experimented with some trendy styles, her go-to look has remained consistent.&nbsp;</p><p>Some characteristics that define her include her carefully<a href=#> placed</a> eyeliner, her brassy under-eye, and a specific lipstick style.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mila_Kunis_Looks_Beautiful_Without_Makeup></span><strong>Mila Kunis’ Looks Beautiful Without Makeup</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite her signature look, Kunis often appears without wearing any makeup. As a result, the actress shows off her natural face more times than with makeup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/2a/82/68/2a82680d2b8ce33f4e01a0d47eb6c678.jpg><p>In 2016 when she graced the cover of Glamour Magazine, Kunis appeared barefaced. Her choice of look surprised many, but the actress looked stunning regardless.&nbsp;</p><p>In her interview with the magazine, the “Friends With Benefits” star disclosed she doesn’t wear makeup or wash her hair every day. Kunis, who revealed wearing makeup is not something she associates herself with, <a href=#>declared</a>:</p><p><strong>“I commend women who wake up 30, 40 minutes to put on eyeliner. I think it’s beautiful, i’m just not the person.”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/e0/e9/7d/e0e97d59a694f14299c58f23db89465c.jpg><p>The actress explained she only wears makeup for work and does not when she isn’t working. Although whenever she has a blemish, the actress tries to cover it up.</p><p>Her go-to remedies are a mascara which she feels wakes her up a bit, and a Chapstick. The actress also likes contouring which she believes changes the whole face.&nbsp;</p><p>Kunis’ prefers a simple makeover with a bit of blush and a little contouring. As for skincare, the actress washes her face twice daily, once inthe morning with Panthenol cleanser and once at night.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kunis_Comes_Under_Fire_for_Bathing_Rules></span><strong>Kunis Comes Under Fire for Bathing Rules&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mila Kunis is married to her husband, actor Ashton Kutcher, and the pair are parents to two kids, Wyatt and Dimitri. However, during their appearance on an episode of Dax Shepard’s Armchair podcast, the couple shockingly explained that they do not take their baths every day.</p><p>Instead, what they do is wash vital parts of their body. Kunis revealed while growing up, she did not bathe many times and has also adopted not bathing her kids. The mother of two only washes her kids when their dirt becomes visible.</p><p>A couple of months after the podcast, Kutcher <a href=#>attended</a> a football match between his hometown team, the University of Iowa, and Iowa State rivals. He then joined the broadcasting team to give his take on the game.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>However, immediately after the crowd noticed the actor, they booed him. They also chanted “take a shower” in response to the interview of him and Kunis. The actor, however, kept his cool and continued with his analysis.</p><p>A couple of weeks later, Kunis and Kutcher had the last laugh when they poked fun at the bathing issue on their social media. The couple and their kids stood in a bathroom, and Kutcher jokingly complained about bathing them too much.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqq4wGairqaZqHq4tdOhZKenXaKurLHUqWSopl2owaq4y2ajqKebqHqou9GgnKito2K1pr7ErGSpqp%2Bks3A%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sofia-coppola-shoots-calder-lookbook.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sofia Coppola Becomes Fashion Photographer-SOFIA COPPOLA PHOTOGRAPHS FASHION LOOKBOOK">&larr;

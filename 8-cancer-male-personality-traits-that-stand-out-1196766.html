Intuitive</strong></p><p>Cancers have keen intuition, and their so-called magic powers show up in physical settings. Cancer men are good at picking up on the energies present in a space. These crabs are fiercely protective of themselves and extremely susceptible to their surroundings. Even if you have never mentioned their issue to them when speaking with them, they will somehow sense your true emotions.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><strong>2. True-hearted</strong></p><p>A Cancer man will be devoted to you and be your lifelong closest friend if you two fall in love. He's the kind of guy you can always count on, and you know he'll be available to help out whoever requires it. But don't expect unwavering devotion immediately away; it takes some time to win over a Cancer's faith. Although they might be slow to open up, once they do, they are entirely yours to keep!</p><p><strong>3. Extremely Protective</strong></p><p>Cancer male is highly loving, devoted, and watchful of his loved ones and will go to any lengths to make you feel safe and secure in their presence. Sometimes to the point of being overly protective of friends and family. They value their closed ones greatly and usually go above and beyond to defend them. They may be a little reserved in their relationships in life since they want to develop stronger and more meaningful bonds.</p><p><strong>4. Homebody</strong></p><p>Being such a loving spirit, the Cancer guy will also want to be a homebody. Rather than leaving the house to engage in more fun gatherings, cancer men would like to be at home and devote time with their <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","8 Cancer Male Personality Traits That Stand Out","1196766","https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/people/4-personality-traits-of-cancer-parents-that-you-must-know-1194978","articlepage","/lifestyle/people/8-cancer-male-personality-traits-that-stand-out-1196766","family","Body_Hyperlink","lifestyle","people")'>family</a>. These males prefer to spend quality time at home. They have a deep sense of their own comfortable setting and would enjoy the calmness and peace they are surrounded with.</p><p><strong>5. Overly Sensitive</strong></p><p>Also, because Cancer is frequently regarded as one of the zodiac's most sensitive signs, the man will almost always act with affection in consideration, which makes him a wonderfully charming and fascinating lover. But the man is also a massive emotional mess. He is clingy and would probably overwhelm you with his neediness, but if you don't give him constant attention, he'll feel neglected. He would therefore expect that you should be emotionally available for him.</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","8 Cancer Male Personality Traits That Stand Out",1196766,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/people/8-negative-traits-of-a-cancer-you-should-be-aware-of-1196499","articlepage","/lifestyle/people/8-cancer-male-personality-traits-that-stand-out-1196766","Content Also read","lifestyle","people"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","8 Cancer Male Personality Traits That Stand Out",1196766,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/people/8-negative-traits-of-a-cancer-you-should-be-aware-of-1196499","articlepage","/lifestyle/people/8-cancer-male-personality-traits-that-stand-out-1196766","8 Negative Traits of a Cancer You Should Be Aware of","Also_Read","lifestyle","people")'><strong>8 Negative Traits of a Cancer You Should Be Aware of</strong></a></p><p><img alt="Cancer Male Personality Traits" title="Cancer Male Personality Traits" width=1280 height=1920 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-10/1667027298_pexels-timur-weber-8560250.jpg></p><p><strong>6. Highly Emotional</strong></p><p>Cancer is renowned for being an emotional, even cranky, sign. Cancer is ruled by the Moon, and like with the moon, its emotions are ever-changing. The men belonging from the zodiac, easily become attached to in a relationship. They'll give you stability, comfort, and support. And since they pour out their feelings quickly to their partner, they might get easily hurt due to a tiny argument with you and pay attention to your petty issues.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><strong>7. Moody</strong></p><p>Due to the intricacy of their sentiments, which can abruptly switch from being exceedingly delighted to terribly unhappy, cancers are renowned for having mood swings. A Cancer man will immediately retreat into their shields when disturbed or upset. They frequently experience mood swings, which might make their companion uncomfortable due to their unpredictable behavior. Additionally, they tend to think that everything they have stated is correct and may not necessarily support their partner's viewpoints.</p><p><strong>8. Nurturing</strong></p><p>The need to care for others is one of the primary strengths of the Cancer personality. They'll look after you and feed you. Therefore, it stands to reason that Cancers are among the zodiac's most compassionate, empathetic, and kind signs. These water signs thrive at giving others love, nurturing, and empathy. They also shine at generating a sense of secure and well-cared-for environment.</p><p>We are very sure that being aware of these aforementioned personality traits will help you progress with your relationship with your potential Cancer male more effectively.</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","8 Cancer Male Personality Traits That Stand Out",1196766,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/people/10-cancer-woman-personality-traits-that-stand-out-1196268","articlepage","/lifestyle/people/8-cancer-male-personality-traits-that-stand-out-1196766","Content Also read","lifestyle","people"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","8 Cancer Male Personality Traits That Stand Out",1196766,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/people/10-cancer-woman-personality-traits-that-stand-out-1196268","articlepage","/lifestyle/people/8-cancer-male-personality-traits-that-stand-out-1196766","10 Cancer Woman Personality Traits That Stand out","Also_Read","lifestyle","people")'><strong>10 Cancer Woman Personality Traits That Stand out</strong></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGijop6VqMG6uMRop56noKGycISMnJinm5Wneq6ty55kqZ2iqLyvrcuiq7JlpKeuqsDSZquhmaRiwLWtzZ1kqK2kYn5yhZVwbW8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./20030321273842.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="CHARLES WELCOMES SPRING WITH TRADITIONAL BULGARIAN BRACELET">&larr;

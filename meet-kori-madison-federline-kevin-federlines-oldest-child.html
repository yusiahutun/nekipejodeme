Her father is Kevin Federline, and her mother is Shar Jackson.&nbsp;Kevin is known because of his high-profile relationships with famous women. As of 2022, he was reportedly working as a DJ.&nbsp;</p><p>He has a passion for music and has attempted to kick-start his musical career several times but with little success.&nbsp;On the other hand, Shar Jackson, his former wife, and Kori’s mother, is a famous actress and model.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/shar.jpg><p>She did some work for Ubiquitous, John Robert Powers, and Barbizon agencies before focusing solely on acting.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_We_Know_About_Kori_Madison_Federline></span>What We Know About Kori Madison Federline<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kori Madison Federline is one of the kids Shar Jackson had with Kevin Federline before they both went their separate ways.&nbsp;She was born on July 31, 2002, in Yorba Linda, California. Jackson and Kevin have done all they can to give her a private life. However, she has been known to join her parents at public functions now and then.&nbsp;</p><p>Kori also rarely gets posted on her mother’s social media pages, but she has an Instagram account. However, she keeps it private.&nbsp;Kori has been described as a “media personality,” “weeb,” and “artist” on her Instagram page.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kori_Madison_Federlines_Father_Reportedly_Cheated_on_Her_Mother_While_She_Was_Pregnant></span>Kori Madison Federline’s Father Reportedly Cheated on Her Mother While She Was Pregnant&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The affair between Kevin and Britney Spears began while Jackson was carrying their second child, which spelled the end of what they shared.&nbsp;Kori was only two when the scandal between her father and Britney Spears happened. Spears had been seeing her father even though he was still married to Jackson.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/868b005ef144ecaff2de2f1dcac7c2d8.jpg><p>In a statement directed to Spears, Jackson said: “How do you call yourself a human knowing that you put somebody else through that pain?”&nbsp;The actress believes Spears entered his life before their split. She called it breaking up a family.&nbsp;</p><p>Jackson and Kevin’s relationship ended as a result, but she has claimed they remain friends.&nbsp;She did not ask Kevin to pay child support, saying she was an “independent woman.” However, after their split, Jackson hoped he would spend much time with their kids.&nbsp;</p><p>Kevin also stepped up. Although he did not have to pay child support, he was responsible for their private school fees.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Koris_Fathers_Marriage_to_Britney_Spears_Did_Not_Last></span>Kori’s Father’s Marriage to Britney Spears Did Not Last<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kevin and Spears met in 2004 and dated for three months before they announced their engagement in July 2004. They tied the knot in September in Studio City, California; however, the union was not meant to last.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kevv.jpg><p>They stayed married for two years and welcomed two boys before going their separate ways.&nbsp;Spears filed for divorce in November 2006, and by March 2007, the process was finalized.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kori_Madison_Federline_Has_Many_Siblings></span>Kori Madison Federline Has Many Siblings&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kori Madison Federline has a brother named Kaleb Michael. He was born on July 20, 2004, to Kevin and Jackson and was their last child before their split.&nbsp;</p><p>Kori also has two <a href=#>older siblings</a>, products of her mom’s previous relationship, and five younger siblings from her dad, including Kaleb, Britney’s sons, and two other kids Kevin shares with his current wife, Victoria Prince.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned, Jackson keeps Kori and her brothers away from the spotlight as much as possible.&nbsp;She hardly ever posts about them but is known to turn up at some events with them in tow. The same goes for Kevin.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Koris_Parents_Excel_at_Co-Parenting></span>Kori’s Parents Excel at Co-Parenting&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Even though Kevin and Jackson’s relationship ended sourly, they were able to work past that to be good parents to the kids they share. A few years after their split, Jackson admitted that Kevin was a great father. Jackson called the former dancer the love of Kori’s life and claimed she got excited when she hears her dad’s voice.</p><p>Jackson said: “Everything he does, as far as his career, and everything like that, he does it for his kids.” Kori has a good relationship with her father despite how things ended between him and her mother. She even got along with <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> while they were together.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02aiqKqZYrqisMispqdllpqxpr7LoqWeZZuaw6q6jJ%2BcnZ2iobavsdJmpqWclajBbq%2FHoqOdZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./video-inside-coco-lees-heartbreaking-battle-learning-walk-again-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Video: Inside CoCo Lee's heartbreaking battle of learning to walk again">&larr;

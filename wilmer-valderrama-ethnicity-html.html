While there is still lots to achieve and change in the area, this has just led more and more people to be proud of who they are and embrace their culture, ethnicity, and nationality.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>More of His Married Life:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Did Wilmer Valderrama Turn Dating Affair Into A Married One?

So, naturally, he possesses Hispanic ethnicity.&nbsp;</p><h2>Proud of His Roots&nbsp;</h2><p>Time and again, Wilmer has expressed his pride in his ethnicity and who he is. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">moved</a> to his father's native country when he was three years old and also visited his mother's home country, Colombia.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He eventually moved back to the U.S. at the age of 14 and started pursuing his education.</p><p>“My parents sold everything they had in Venezuela, just so they could afford to bring us, the family, to the United States in search of a better opportunity,”&nbsp;Wilmer said of his parent's sacrifices and contribution to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">People</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>He further shared how the whole family used humor to cope with the difficulties they faced after returning to the US.&nbsp;</p><p>“Growing up in that household was very fun, very funny, and in the face of tragedy, a sense of humor, it was a big one.” He shared.&nbsp;“They gave us a sense of humor to disarm the trauma that comes with going to a country, with being suppressed, being looked at as inferior because you have a strong accent.”</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><img alt="Wilmer Valderrama with His Parents" height=411 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/Wilmer-Valderrama-Parents.jpg width=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Wilmer Valderrama with His Parents </strong>(Source <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Daily Mail</a>)</p><p>He recalled how his parents always tried to look at it differently and find light in the darkness no matter how tough the situation.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-631 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Is The Heir To Russian Royalty “Mark Farancis Vandelli” Gay?

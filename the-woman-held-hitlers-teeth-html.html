Among them was a team of counterintelligence investigators.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Working for them was a 25-year-old interpreter called Yelena Rzhevskaya.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As her regular role involved interrogating captured Germans, she might have thought when she was summoned that afternoon to the office of her commander, Colonel Gorbushin, that she was going to be wheedling some intelligence out of a Nazi.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Instead, Gorbushin handed Yelena a box.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It was a second-hand, burgundy box with a soft lining and covered with satin,’ Yelena later recalled.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She asked Gorbushin what it contained. His matter-of-fact reply startled her. ‘Hitler’s teeth,’ he said. ‘And if you lose them, you’ll be answerable with your head.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>What followed remains one of the strangest missions of the entire Second World War.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Although German radio had announced that the Nazi leader had killed himself eight days before, on April 30, 1945, confirmation was needed urgently.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Many suspected the Fuhrer could have escaped from Berlin and was either hiding somewhere in the Bavarian Alps, or even under the waves of the Atlantic in a submarine en route to South America.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-be1562a29d02ac02 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/21/20/4B67418800000578-0-image-m-9_1524338971697.jpg height=763 width=634 alt="Yelena Rzhevskaya's memoirs will hopefully dismantle the increasingly popular conspiracy theory that claims Hitler did indeed survive the war…" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Yelena Rzhevskaya's memoirs will hopefully dismantle the increasingly popular conspiracy theory that claims Hitler did indeed survive the war…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The task faced by Yelena’s unit was to see whether the charred teeth discovered in the grounds of the Reich Chancellery really did belong to Hitler.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Today, thanks to the long-awaited publication of Yelena’s memoirs in English, the world can finally learn the true story of how the Russians confirmed the Fuhrer’s death.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her memoirs will hopefully dismantle the increasingly popular conspiracy theory that claims Hitler did indeed survive the war…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So why was Yelena chosen for this historic task? That was the first question she asked as she opened the satin box to find a charred fragment of lower jaw and some dentures.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Because we have no safe here,’ replied, Colonel Gorbushin, ‘and as a woman, you’re less likely than a man to get drunk and then lose them.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Yelena was almost overawed by her new responsibility, and later admitted that she turned cold whenever she worried about losing the box.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her first objective was to track down Hitler’s dentist – no easy task in the chaos of the war-torn German capital.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-45776379e27fe1c7 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/21/20/4B67418C00000578-0-image-a-8_1524338966353.jpg height=332 width=634 alt="After searching through a cabinet, the team found X-rays of Hitler’s teeth and his dental records witch matched the fragment of jaw" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>After searching through a cabinet, the team found X-rays of Hitler’s teeth and his dental records witch matched the fragment of jaw</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>With their driver Sergei behind the wheel of a Ford 8 saloon, she and her two officers headed into the centre of Berlin.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘In places smoke was still rising, the city’s air still filled with the fumes of battle,’ she wrote.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The barricades, crushed by tank tracks, had yet to be dismantled.’ After many hours, the team pulled up at a hospital, and enquiries were made about who had looked after Hitler’s teeth.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The doctor in charge did not know, and the only name he was able to supply of those who had treated Hitler was that of the internationally renowned laryngologist Professor Carl von Eicken, who headed the Charite clinic.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was the only lead they had, and later that day, the team arrived at the clinic.

However, almost as soon as the team arrived, it looked like they had reached a dead-end.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A man called Dr Bruck informed them that Dr Blaschke had flown from Berlin to Bavaria. Nevertheless, the team looked around the surgery, until Col Gorbushin asked if Dr Bruck was in contact with any of Blaschke’s employees.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Of course!’ Dr Bruck exclaimed. ‘You mean Kathchen? Kathe Heusermann? She is at home in her apartment right on our doorstep.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Within a few minutes, an attractive woman in a dark blue flared coat came in.

During rehearsals, Apatow did some "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>guerilla style shoots</a>" with a number of the performers, including Katy Perry. As part of this fated collaboration, Apatow's star, Brand, was to share a kiss with the "Hot N Cold" singer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The scene was ultimately cut (because the process of art imitating life became "too literal," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>according to Perry</a>), but it was still a defining moment in Brand and Perry's eventual relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"On the way down the stairs after the scene, I was hopping like a bunny," Perry told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Glamour</a> about her cameo. "I hop like a bunny when I'm happy — I get a bit childlike," she said. "He gives me the Christmas Eve jitters."About a year later, Brand hosted the 2009 VMA's, and Perry won the Brit over by … throwing a bottle at his head?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was 25, 30 feet away from him. And I threw the bottle straight at him," Perry told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Esquire</a>. "Hit him smack dab on the head."Brand wasn't initially amused by Perry's strangely violent pick-up method, but it was ultimately successful."I was really annoyed," Brand told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Metro</a>, "but when she came up to me she was so mouthy, smart and cocky, it made me really interested."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By the end of the night, he and Perry were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>spotted kissing</a> at Lady Gaga's after-party.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dating speculation intensified the following month after both parties tweeted about vacationing in Thailand.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But it wasn't long before Brand and Perry went from rumored to radically public.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm in love with someone," Brand confirmed during <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a visit to UK talk show Loose Women</a> in December 2009. "I feel ill."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By January, they were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>engaged</a>. They <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>wed that October</a> in a traditional Hindu ceremony in India (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Brand was a practicing Hindu at the time</a>).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them:</strong> There was seemingly nothing off-limits when it came to the media, for better or worse.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perry declared that Brand "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>used to basically be a professional prostitute</a>" before she met him. Brand told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Details</a> that his marriage was "at once the most mundane and spectacular thing in the world."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Exemplifying both the mundane and spectacular,<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1> Perry told Ellen DeGeneres</a> that she and Brand shared a cat named after both of them: Krusty — "Katy and Rusty, but meshed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an extremely 2010 turn of events, Brand and Perry got <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>matching Sanskrit script tattooed on the underside of each of their right arms</a> that translates to "go with the flow." Brand's has <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>allegedly since been removed</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked:</strong> Brand and Perry were basically the Kanye West and Julia Fox of 2009. Not unlike a "Firework," they burned bright, but the spectacle was short-lived.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Case in point, Perry put on a sartorial show of affection for Brand at the MTV Europe Music Awards that November. The singer was photographed in a strapless bustier and matching boy shorts bearing the crest and colors of UK football club West Ham United (Brand's favorite team). Perry's shorts read "Rusty" (Brand's nickname) across the butt.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That was significant, when she did that," Brand said during his appearance on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Loose Women</a>. "It was like she reached into my childhood and made everything all better." Sweet, but not subtle — you know, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>gifting your girlfriend of mere weeks and her entire friend group Birkin bags</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Divorce rumors hit hard in late 2011, but both parties assured fans they were untrue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"First I'm pregnant & then I'm divorced. What am I All My Children?!" <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Perry tweeted</a>, alluding to previous pregnancy rumors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I am really happily married," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Brand told DeGeneres</a> while visiting her talk show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But, alas, Krusty would not live to see the new year (the couple, not the cat).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Dec. 30, Brand filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. "Sadly, Katy and I are ending our marriage," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>. "I'll always adore her and I know we'll remain friends."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Speaking to Howard Stern</a> that summer, Brand described marrying Perry as "the sensible thing to do," because he "just loved her so much."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was really, really in love with her, but it was difficult to see each other," he said. "It was a lovely relationship ... It mostly didn't work for practical reasons."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The following year, Perry provided a better idea of what transpired between her and Brand."Let's just say I haven't heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31, 2011," she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Vogue</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"At first when I met him he wanted an equal, and I think a lot of times strong men do want an equal, but then they get that equal and they're like, I can't handle the equalness," she went on. "He didn't like the atmosphere of me being the boss on tour. So that was really hurtful, and it was very controlling, which was upsetting."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">OK, so more than "practical reasons" … In an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Sunday Times</a>, Perry said she was "in bed for about two weeks" following the split.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was pretty fucked, yes. It hurt a lot — I got a good knock."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Unfortunately, although I had the outward self-identity, I didn't have the inner kind, I hadn't built that up. My self-worth was in someone else's hands which is never a good idea, because it can be taken from you at any time. And it was, and it was shattered."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brand continued to paint a wildly different portrait of his and Perry's relationship in the press, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>telling Today's Matt Lauer that he "really enjoyed" being married</a> to the singer. "Katy Perry is an amazing person."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[Divorce] was emotionally traumatic for me," Perry told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rolling Stone</a> in 2014. "It was the death of a dream. I was in fairy tale land, and the reality of it wasn't so."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While visiting <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Watch What Happens Live</a> in 2014, Brand was asked to name the best and worst things about being married to Perry. He complied, telling host Andy Cohen, "The best thing is she's really exciting, and brilliant, and good fun, and the worst thing I suppose is things like that don't last forever."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When the trailer for Brand's 2015 documentary BRAND: A Second Coming was released, another piece of the enigmatic breakup puzzle was revealed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Oh my fucking God. I'm living, like, this life of the very thing I detest: vapid, vacuous celebrity," Brand says in the trailer, layered upon footage of him and Perry. Ah, fame, relationship kryptonite.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_82-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Furthering this notion, in 2017 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>he told UKTV's John Bishop</a>, "The marriage didn't last for a very long time, and I think that is to do with the undulating nature of fame."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_84-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perry gave her final word on the relationship in 2020. "I was having great success at 23, 24, and 25, and then I met someone that was interesting and stimulating," she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>60 Minutes Australia</a>. "It was just like a tornado, it was everything happening at once."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_88-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brand married Laura Gallacher in 2017. The couple share two children: Mabel, 5, and Peggy, 3.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_90-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Russell's latest appearance is in the long-awaited murder mystery Death on the Nile, currently in theaters.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_92-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perry and longtime boyfriend Orlando Bloom got engaged on Valentine's Day in 2019. She and the Pirates of the Caribbean star welcomed their first daughter together, Daisy Dove, in August 2020.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_94-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The singer has been a judge on American Idol since 2018.

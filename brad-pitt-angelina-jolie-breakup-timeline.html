I had just turned 16, but even now, nine years later, I still remember exactly how that movie made me feel: In a word, good. Extremely good. And Angelina and Brad? I thought they were perfect. I had seen them individually in separate movies, of course — Angelina in Tomb Raider and Brad in Troy — but there was some sort of power in the both of them coming together. Their explosive chemistry felt dangerous and thrilling.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Immediately after the movie, I hopped on my brother's old MacBook and Googled their names. It was April, and news of their engagement had just been announced. I remember bouncing up and down as I read article upon article about their lives, their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>charitable work</a>, and their love story. My toes curled in delight. I became deeply invested in the Brangelina fandom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2016, when Angelina Jolie filed for a divorce after 11 years with Brad, citing irreconcilable differences, I was almost as shocked as I was devastated. As more <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>details</a> about their divorce became public — including a report that they "fought a lot over the years … and disagreed about many things," I wondered if their perfection was a facade. As though that was not bad enough, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>accusations of child abuse</a> against Brad arose, and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>messy custody battle</a> ensued. I was horrified.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>20th Century Fox/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two years later, in 2018, I met a boy whom I thought had the stars in his eyes. He, bless him, thought I had the stars reflected in mine, astigmatism notwithstanding. We fell in love.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time we met, he was in what he termed "a breaking relationship" with someone else, but that did not stop us from becoming fast friends. When he said that he liked me, I told him I would not be with someone who was with someone else.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There's no love between us anymore," he said about the girl, "the only reason we're together is out of habit."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't care," I said back, "It's cheating and I will not be a part of it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A month later, he came back to say he had broken up with her and they were exes now. A week later, we were officially together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I was 21 then, and 5 years had passed since I had read everything there was to be read about Brangelina, including that Brad had still been married to Jennifer Aniston when it was rumored that he had started an affair with Angelina.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Sometimes you do meet the perfect people at imperfect times," I would say to myself every time I felt like I was doing something wrong by being with him, every time it felt like I was stealing this man away from someone else. This thought persisted, even though I believed on an intellectual level that nobody, least of all a 23-year old man, could be stolen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We had been dating for eight months when Brad and Angelina were officially granted "single" status by the court. And although the divorce proceedings had started three years before, a small part of me had still harbored hope that they would reconsider how perfect they were as a couple and put a stop to it.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Early in 2020,<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> a photo of a very friendly Brad and Jennifer Aniston</a> at an award show surfaced. My friend sent the photo to me, and captioned it "Omg! Do you think they're getting back together?!" I told her I didn't think it worked that way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As though nature was playing a cruel joke on me, that weekend when my boyfriend and I went to the park, we ran into his ex. And as we waited in line for the water ride ticket, they made small talk — she on his right, me on his left smiling awkwardly at their inside jokes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And because situations like this can only get crueler, my boyfriend and I got separated when we entered the water splash. I ended up behind him and his ex, sharing a bench with a lone kid. As we slid down the drop, their excited screeches filled my head. I barely resisted letting out a screech of my own, not out of excitement but frustration at how good they looked together, how in sync even their excited screeches sounded.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The week after, I broke up with my boyfriend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Why?" he asked, his brows furrowed the way they did when he was trying to solve a difficult math problem.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't know," I shrugged, "It just seems like the right thing to do."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I thought of Brangelina then, and what I considered to be their perfect union, and I was convinced that the relationship's ending was some sort of karmic payback because of how it had started. Of course, I thought, mine was bound to fail, too. All that kept ringing in my head was the first principal of the Law of Equity I had learned years ago in my law classroom — where there are two equal equities, the first in time prevails.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When there are two loves, I thought, the first surpasses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Six months later, on his Instagram was a highlight titled love. It was a picture of him and the girl I had met at the park — his ex — smiling at each other.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Their excited, coordinated screeches rang again in my head.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Breakups That Broke Us is a weekly column about the failed celebrity relationships that convinced us love is dead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8GrmJ1loJ7BtXnAp56epJmjrm62zqWgnmWSp7Kit9SpZK2hnZq5qrrE</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./johnny-fratto-wiki-family-book-death-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Johnny Fratto">&larr;

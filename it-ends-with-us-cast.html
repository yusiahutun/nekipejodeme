The book follows Lily Bloom, a college graduate who moves to Boston, where she meets handsome neurosurgeon, Ryle Kincaid, and reconnects with her old boyfriend and first love, Atlas Corrigan. “Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his ‘no dating’ rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened,” the book’s description reads.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Publishers Weekly</a> in 2017, Hoover explained that It Ends With Us was based on the relationship between her mother and father. “I was inspired by my mother to write it,” Hoover says. “The book was based on her relationship with my father; she divorced him when I was about two years old. The author’s note at the end explains how the story related to my parents. I fashioned the main characters, Lily and Ryle, after them, and the first time he hits her is actually what happened between my parents.”</p><p>Hoover continued, “She called after she finished it. She was crying and couldn’t even talk. So she texted me and said that for 35 years she wondered if she had made the right choice by leaving him. And this book solidified that [decision]. I hope readers take away that people deserve respect in relationships,. Not just women, but everyone.”</p><p>Hoover also opened up about the public response to It Ends With Us. “I was very nervous because it was a departure from what I usually write,” she said. “But I had the biggest response that I’ve ever had to any book. It’s changed lives. Women have given this to friends who needed it. I’ve always said I write to entertain, I don’t write to educate or inform. But it’s something else when you write a book, and it actually does have an impact on people in a positive way.”</p><p>Since it was published in 2016, It Ends With Us has sold more than one million copies across the world and been translated into more than 20 languages. It debuted at number one on The New York Times best sellers list in January 2022 and was number one on Publishers Weekly’s adult list and number one on its overall list for the first six months of 2022. Hoover credits the recent success of the novel to the #<a href=# rel=noopener>BookTok</a> community on TikTok. A sequel titled It Starts With Us was published in October 2022.</p><p><span class=s1>In 2019, Hoover announced that a movie adaptation of <i>It Ends With Us</i> was in the works.

Colleen Hoover, who wrote It Ends With Us, announced in an Instagram video in January 2023 that Blake Lively would play Lily in the It Ends With Us&nbsp;movie. Lively is also an executive producer of the film. “We have a cast and I’m going to tell you who our Ryle and Lily are,” Hoover said in the video. “Our Lily is going to be played by Blake Lively. Blake Lively, y’all! She’s my dream Lily.” She added, “Blake Lively! Blake Lively! I can’t say it enough.” She captioned the video, “CAST ANNOUNCEMENT for #ItEndsWithUsMovie! ❤️ So grateful to all of you for the support. AND TO YOU, MOM 😍.” After the announcement, Lively posted a photo of her with red hair on her Instagram Story. (In the It Ends With Us book, Lily is described as a redhead.)</p><p>Lily, the protagonist of It Ends With Us, is a young college graduate who moves to Boston, Massachusetts, where she opens her own floral business and meets Ryle Kincaid, a neurosurgeon who she starts a serious relationship with. While on a date with Ryle, Lily runs into Atlas Corrigan, her first love and teenage boyfriend who Ryle suspects she still has feelings for.</p><p>There was a little controversy regarding Lively’s casting, as the actor is more than a decade older than the character she’s portraying—the 23-year-old Lily. Five months after the news of Lively’s casting, Hoover defended the move but admitted the casting was actually rectifying a mistake made by the author herself. “Back when I wrote&nbsp;It Ends With Us, the new adult [genre] was very popular,” she said at Book Bonanza, Hoover’s annual book festival held in Grapevine, Texas, according to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Today</a>. “You were writing college-age characters. That’s what I was contracted to do.” The author continued, “I didn’t know that neurosurgeons went to school for 50 years. There’s not a 20-something neurosurgeon,” admitting that it was the author’s fault. “As I started making this movie, I’m like, ‘We need to age them out because I messed up,’” she said. “So that’s my fault.”</p><p>However, Hoover said she was thrilled with how the on-screen adaptation is coming together. “I got to see the footage they filmed thus far,” she said, per&nbsp;Today. “I’m not a crier. I know that I write emotional <a href=# id=auto-tag_books data-tag=books>books</a> but I’m not an emotional person. And I cried so much on set.” Hoover continued, “You guys are going to be so happy. I’m extremely happy and now my expectations are up and I’m going to keep them there.”</p><p>Isabela Ferrer was announced as young Lily on January 16, 2024, according to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://deadline.com/2024/01/isabela-ferrer-alex-neustaeder-young-lily-young-atlas-it-ends-with-us-1235794239/>Deadline.</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-plays-ryle-kincaid-in-it-ends-with-us>Who plays Ryle Kincaid in It Ends With Us?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Justin-Baldoni.jpg><p>Who plays Ryle Kincaid in It Ends With Us? Colleen Hoover announced in an Instagram video in January 2023 that Justin Baldoni will play Ryle in the It Ends With Us movie. Baldoni is also the director and an executive producer on the film. “When I first met Justin Baldoni, who is directing the film for It Ends With Us, I immediately wanted him to be Ryle,” Hoover said in the video. “I just had thought that he had what it takes to play that character, and the good news is he’s going to be Ryle. So we have our Ryle and our Lily. I think Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively have what it takes to bring these characters to life and I cannot wait for you guys to see that happen.”</p><p>She continued, “I’m going to do my best to sneak y’all as much footage as I can without getting kicked off the set. I’m so excited y’all. I can’t even wrap my mind around this. That I’m going to to get to go on set, that I got to read the amazing script, and I know y’all are going to be happy. Y’all are going to be happy.”</p><p>Ryle, a neurosurgeon, is one of Lily Bloom’s two love interests in It Ends With Us, along with Atlas Corrigan.

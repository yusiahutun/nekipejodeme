I asked what for, and was told that a column was going to be put up there for the night. I wanted to go over, but would not be allowed; other armed men were patrolling the road from Annie's Bridge to Murphy's Lodge. I had no option but to give up the keys, and suspecting what was on I pointed out to the leader that the house was not Colonel Moore's property. This had no effect. I sat up all night, hoping that when all would be clear I could save even a portion of the library.&nbsp;At four o'clock I heard four loud explosions. At five I went to the place and found the whole house was seething in a mass of flames. I at once saw that all was hopeless. A fire brigade would be powerless, so firmly had the flames gripped the entire building. I could do nothing but stand by and await the end with the same feelings that one has when standing by the open grave of a very dear friend. I do not say this in the 'Uriah Heepish' way, for I really loved that old house. To me it was a modern edition of King Tutankhamen's tomb. At six o'clock the roof fell in with a terrific crash. When the fire died down I got ladders up to the library windows, hoping to save a few books, but nothing living could enter, so fierce was the heat. When Mr Ruttledge returns I would like to have instructions as to what is to be done. There is several feet of litter on the ground floor. I don't know if it be worth while to remove this - except&nbsp; steel or iron one cannot hope to find anything. In one sense, perhaps, the house had outlived its usefulness, but still it would be a pity even now to let it become a real ruin. If nothing can be done I would suggest building up the lower windows to prevent people trafficking in and out as they please.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>These lines will seem to many too simple to be considered as 'literature'; the many like ornament.

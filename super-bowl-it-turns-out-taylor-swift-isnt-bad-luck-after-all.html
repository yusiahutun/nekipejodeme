They became public knowledge in September after the 34-year-old attended one of <a href=#>Travis Kelce’s</a> games and, despite her busy schedule, she has traveled to watch 13 of the 19 games he’s played. Last night, she was in attendance at the 2024 <a href=#>Super Bowl</a> which saw the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22. Now, Swifties are point how Taylor’s support may have tilted the game in the Chiefs’ favor.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-say-taylor-swift-wasn-t-bad-luck-for-the-super-bowl>Fans say Taylor Swift wasn’t ‘bad luck’ for the Super Bowl</h2><p>Taking to X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>) Taylor Swift fans said she wasn’t as much bad luck as Chiefs fans thought after they won the Super Bowl last night (February 11).</p><p>The Chiefs won over the 49ers during overtime, and their victory was quite a big jump from their position at halftime. During the game’s break, the score was 10-3 and the 49ers were in the lead.</p><p>However, they came back out fighting and managed to win the Super Bowl trophy while Travis’ <a href=#>music</a> star girlfriend was cheering him on in one of the VIP boxes.</p><p>Now, fans are pointing out that Taylor, 34, might just have been the key to their win rather than hindering it.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift ‘will have two Super Bowl entrances’ planned, celebrity psychic predicts</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m old enough to remember Kansas City fans saying Taylor Swift brought the team bad luck…</p><p>Look what you made her do..</p>— President Kamala’s Hand (Again) (@myronjclifton) <a href=#>February 12, 2024</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><p>“I remember there was a narrative out there Taylor Swift was a bad luck charm for the Chiefs.

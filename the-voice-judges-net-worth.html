We know about their salaries, but what about <a rel=noopener href=#>The Voice judge’s net worths</a>? Well, like their paychecks, The Voice judges aren’t on the same levels of wealth. But that doesn’t mean they’re paid pennies either. Each of the coaches is a millionaire (obvi), but which one is worth the most? We do the investigative work ahead.</p><p>The Voice premiered in April 2011 with <a href=# rel=noopener>coaches Blake Shelton,</a> Adam Levine, Christina Aguilera and Cee Lo Green. Immediately, the show became a hit for its simple but irresistible premise: You can only judge singers on their voice. In the audition rounds, the judges’ chairs are turned around as contestants perform. If they like a contestant and want them on their team, they press the red button in front of them, which turns around their chairs and allows them to see the singer. If more than one judge presses his or her button, the contestant is allowed to choose the celebrity they want as their coach—but not before a hilarious bidding war between the famous judges.</p><p>While the voice-only premise just lasts for the audition rounds, it still makes for a fun and innovative singing competition. It’s no wonder <a rel=noopener href=#>The Voice</a> has been on TV for almost a decade. Find out how much each of the show’s past and present judges are worth ahead.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.95703125><h2>CeeLo Green</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-voice-ceelo-green.jpg><p><span class=s1>Seasons: 1 – 3, 5</span></p><p><span class=s1>Net worth: $10 million</span></p><p>CeeLo was one of The Voice’s four OG judges when the show premiered in 2011.

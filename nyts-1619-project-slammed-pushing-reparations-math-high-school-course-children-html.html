A 2020 report by <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Real Clear Investigations</a>&nbsp;found that 1619 courses had been adopted in over 3,500 classrooms across all 50 states.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But several states, including Arkansas and Mississippi, have since introduced legislation that bans schools from using the lesson plans after critics slammed them as 'racially divisive'.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-90d26c9af036f51e src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/06/06/20/71834661-12166457-image-a-1_1686078871390.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="The 1619 Project was founded in 2019 by journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones (pictured)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The 1619 Project was founded in 2019 by journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones (pictured)&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Over a four-week course, students will cover a series of objectives aiming to answer the 'essential question' of the curriculum: 'Should reparations be paid for the United Statesâ€™ use of enslaved labor?

wealth gap for African Americans in the U.S.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Students are also asked to analyze news media's reception to the idea of reparations, and how different payment methods

African Americans over time,' it adds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But critics have slammed the proposals, with constitutional expert and Texas Public Policy Foundation senior fellow Carol Swain telling <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>The College Fix</a>&nbsp;the 1619 project should not have a place in children's education.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It is disheartening to watch the influence the historically inaccurate and flawed 1619 Project is having on American society through seemingly unlimited access to ideologically mainstream media platforms that never allow anyone to question their flawed narratives,' she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The curriculum materials for math are clearly geared towards politicizing the youngest minds.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 1619 project has previously come under fire for promoting Critical Race Theory in classrooms, a&nbsp;controversial racial justice theory.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While proponents argue it is necessary in the struggle to end racism in the nation going forward, critics claim children are being&nbsp;indoctrinated into thinking that white people are inherently racist or sexist.</p><img id=i-efb0156f0bdfcb9f

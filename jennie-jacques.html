She is best known for her role as Judith in the hit historical drama “Vikings.”</p><p>Despite the fact that she only began acting ten years ago, she has already landed several notable roles, including Ree-Ree in “Shank” and Jasmine in “Demons Never Die.” Her first major part was in “Desperate Romantics,” a BBC drama about the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a group of 19th-century English artists. Following that, she won fans’ hearts by portraying the first female police constable (WPC) in “WPC 56,” a BBC historical police drama. All of these appearances helped her establish a reputation as a versatile actress who can play any character, both lead and supporting.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Jennie_Jacques_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Jennie Jacques? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>According to multiple credible sources, as of 2022, Jacques has a <strong>net worth</strong> of around $1.2 million, which she has amassed by choosing the proper jobs and working hard to broaden her repertoire. Given her youth, she will undoubtedly earn much more, resulting in a bigger net worth in the near future.</p><h2><span id=Jennie_Jacques-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Jennie Jacques- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Jennie was born into an English family, together with six brothers and sisters, in Walgrave Hospital in Coventry, England’s West Midlands region. There is no information available on her parents’ names, nor do we know anything about their occupations or where they live. Despite her popularity, Jennie has successfully dodged all inquiries about her parents and siblings.</p><p>This is a clear indication of her professionalism, as she refuses to let anything from her personal life interfere with her professional life. We do know that the Jacques family traveled around a lot, as little Jennie spent a lot of her youth in places like Leamington Spa and Warwick for no apparent reason. Furthermore, we are unable to determine whether she learned her skills through official education or through other means. What has been established is that she graduated from an unnamed high school in 2008.</p><h2><span id=Jennie_Jacques-_Relationship_Boyfriend>Jennie Jacques- Relationship, Boyfriend</span></h2><p>Jennie is currently dating Evan Todd, a Juilliard graduate who is also an actress and musician. The two were originally cautious to announce their relationship, but after a while, they began uploading cute photographs on social media. There is no information available about when they met or if they plan to marry anytime soon. Evan and Jennie are both discreet people, thus there are no controversies or scandals surrounding them.</p><h2><span id=Jennie_Jacques-_Professional_Career>Jennie Jacques- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Unlike most modern-day stars, Jennie’s resume is devoid of any credits from her adolescence, making her a late bloomer. Katie Fielding in the hit ITV police drama “The Bill” was her debut part. The series, which was primarily shot in South London, portrays the lives of police officers battling with a crime in the United Kingdom’s capital city.</p><p>Jennie performed a pivotal role in “Teenage Kicks,” a two-part episode that helped her establish a reputation for herself and launch her career. Jacques then played Annie Miller in the mini-series “Desperate Romantics,” which is set in 19th century London and depicts the lives and hardships of England’s artistic elite at the period, with a focus on socio-economic situations typical of the Victorian age. She featured in all six episodes of the series, gaining a lot of attention and solidifying her already good reputation. In 2010, she starred as Emily Mullins in an episode of “Lark Rise to Candleford.”</p><h3><span id=Success_Continues_Shank_7_Lives_Demons_Never_Die>Success Continues: Shank, 7 Lives, Demons Never Die</span></h3><p>Jennie chose to try her hand at film after establishing herself as a talented supporting actor on television. As a result, she was cast as Ree-Ree in “Shank,” an action drama set in dystopian London, in 2010. After several decades of instability and disarray, the city is now ruled by gangs that are constantly at odds with one another. While the film was not well received by critics, Jacques’ performance was appreciated, as she demonstrated the ability to stay in character for a lengthy amount of time.</p><p>The young actress had a busy year in 2010, appearing in “Cherry Tree Lane,” “Stanley Park,” “7 Lives,” and several other short films. In 2011, she participated in her debut slasher film, “Demons Never Die,” as Jasmine, and wowed with her genuine portrayal and dedication to the job. During a sex scene involving herself and Robert Sheehan, she appeared naked at one point. Jennie, Herself said that it was a disturbing event for her, but she accepted the responsibilities imposed upon her.</p><h3><span id=WPC_56_Father_Brown_and_Other_Well-Known_Figures>WPC 56, Father Brown, and Other Well-Known Figures</span></h3><p>Jennie was cast in the 2013 film “WPC 56” as police officer Gina Dawson, England’s first female constable. The show traces her journey to that position while also illustrating the discrimination and harassment she suffered in the 1950s. Jacques appears in ten of the fifteen episodes of the show. This was her first main part, and she excelled at conveying emotions and accurately portraying an important historical character.</p><p>Around the same time, she was cast as Violet Parnassus in the TV series “Father Brown,” and in 2015, she played Tash in “Delivery Man,” a show about Matthew, a former cop who chooses to become a midwife. The majority of the plotlines in the program focus on the discrimination he suffers as a result of his gender, all wrapped up in a slew of brilliant jokes.</p><h3><span id=Judith_in_8220Vikings8221_Jennie8217s_Magnum_Opus>Judith in “Vikings,” Jennie’s Magnum Opus</span></h3><p>While Jennie has had a number of memorable roles, none have surpassed her portrayal of Saxon queen Judith in the hit History miniseries “Vikings.” Her character is based on a historical lady, Queen Consort of Wessex in the ninth century, and the daughter of Queen Ealhswith and King Aelle of Northumbria. Jennie was able to successfully add flair to the show by utilizing her versatility, as Judith was one of the most prominent characters in seasons three through five. Critics all over the world loved her portrayal; in fact, it was this role that catapulted her to global recognition, as she was mostly unknown outside of the United Kingdom prior to her appearance in “Vikings.” Given that her character will no longer exist. Jacques is now concentrating on her part as Amber in “London Kills.”</p><h3><span id=Activism_Against_Epilepsy>Activism Against Epilepsy</span></h3><p>Jennie grew raised with six siblings, as previously stated. Unfortunately, one of her sisters has epilepsy and had to have emergency brain surgery after a particularly severe seizure. As a result, Jennie is engaged in raising awareness about epilepsy and is actively involved in various programs aimed at eradicating the stigma associated with the disease and those who suffer from it. She is a spokesman and activist, and she has organized multiple events to assist support attempts to discover a treatment for this disease.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Jennie Jacques stands <strong>5ft 3ins (160cm)</strong> tall, however, her weight and other stats are unknown. Her eyes are pale blue, and her hair is practically pitch black.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media>Social Media</span></h2><p>Because of the ever-expanding reach of social media on global audiences, it is in most celebrities’ best interests to keep their fans up to date on their activities in order to maintain and potentially grow their ratings and profit. Jennie is no new to this trendy trend, as her commitment to updating her public profiles and connecting with her followers is at an all-time high. Her official Facebook profile has 17,000 ‘likes,’ with an additional 18,000 interacting with her on Twitter. Her favorite social network, though, is Instagram, where she has 250,000 followers and routinely publishes photos and updates from her shooting sessions.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Donovan Clingan</a>, <a href=#>Mackenzie Grimsley</a>, and <a href=#>Katyajin</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Steven Wong</a></h3>Steven Wong estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

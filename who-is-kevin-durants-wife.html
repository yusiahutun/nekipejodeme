He plays for the Brooklyn Nets in the National Basketball Association and has had the eyes of many on him.&nbsp;</p><p>He played for Texas Tech University and is recognized by his initials KD. Some of his top accomplishments was being the first year chosen as the Naismith College Player of the Year while still in college.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to that, he has won three Olympic gold medals, four NBA scoring championships, two NBA All-Star Game MVP Awards, two NBA Finals MVP Awards, the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, and the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.&nbsp;</p><p>Given such amazing prospects, it is unsurprising that Durant has an exciting personal life. The topic of who his wife is gets discussed often, leaving many wondering if he is married.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kevvi-fotor-20230705172047.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Kevin_Durants_Wife></span>Who Is Kevin Durant’s Wife?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kevin Durant has no wife and has not been married in the past.&nbsp;The closest Durant had gotten to marriage was in 2013 when he got engaged to his then-girlfriend, WNBA player Monica Wright.&nbsp;</p><p>The two reportedly <a href=#>met</a> in the 2006 McDonald’s High School All-American Game and struck it off.&nbsp;They started dating in May 2013, but as far back as 2011, there are tweets from Durant that <a href=#>suggest</a> he may have had his eyes on romance with Wright.&nbsp;</p><p>Not a lot is known about their relationship. However, Durant allegedly asked Wright to marry him one Saturday night. She said yes and was immediately seen sporting a ring afterward.&nbsp;Sadly things did not go as planned, and the former couple later called off their engagement.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/moni.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kevin_Durants_Wife_Does_Not_Exist_Yet_But_He_Allegedly_Has_a_Girlfriend></span>Kevin Durant’s Wife Does Not Exist Yet, But He Allegedly Has a Girlfriend&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kevin Durant is currently in a relationship with a former athlete named Cassandra Anderson.&nbsp;She was brought up in California and is presently employed as a realtor for Berkshire Hathaway Drysdale Properties.&nbsp;</p><p>Anderson attended Bakersfield High School, where she showcased her sporting skills. In 2007, she won the offensive MVP award and Bakersfield Golden Player of the Year thrice.&nbsp;When Anderson moved on to the University of Florida, she played volleyball, alongside Callie Rivers, daughter of Doc Rivers, for the Gators.</p><p>She graduated with a bachelor’s degree in tourism and recreation in 2012. Then she launched her career in real estate in 2016.&nbsp;She began working in real estate in Los Angeles, California, but after one year, she relocated to Pleasanton. She started working at Berkshire Hathaway in 2017.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Kevin_Durant_Meet_His_Girlfriend></span>How Did Kevin Durant Meet His Girlfriend?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Durant and Anderson became acquaintances in 2017. Anderson was pictured attending Durant’s games while seated in the spouses’ area while he was playing for the Golden State Warriors.&nbsp;</p><p>Durant started to pop up on her Snapchat page in late January 2018. The two are known to share videos that capture them having fun.&nbsp;After his engagement with Wright ended, Durant chose to keep his relationship with Anderson under wraps.</p><p>Unfortunately, in 2020, sources claimed that Durant is no longer listed on Anderson’s profile. Speculations that they might be done with each other rose even more when Anderson deleted her Instagram account.&nbsp;</p><p>It makes it seem like the alleged relationship has already run its course, or the couple has just gotten good at keeping things under wraps.&nbsp;Many wonder if she will eventually become Kevin Durant’s wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cassss-fotor-20230705171927-1024x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Kevin_Durant_Have_Kids></span>Does Kevin Durant Have Kids?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, Kevin Durant is currently not a father. He is navigating the choppy waters of love, but if his personality is anything to go by, there will be some in the future.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kevin_Durants_Famous_Fling></span>Kevin Durant’s Famous Fling<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>During an appearance on the show “3 Ladies 1 Kitchen,” Lana Rhoades, a former adult film actress turned Instagram fitness model, <a href=#>discussed</a> her date with an “unnamed” Brooklyn Nets player.&nbsp;Given Durant’s popularity, it did not take long for rumors that claimed it was him to surface.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Cassandra_Anderson></span>Who Is Cassandra Anderson?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Anderson is an African-American who is American by birth. She was born on May 25, 1990, and stands about 6 feet 1 inches tall.&nbsp;She used to play volleyball in college because of her height but did not become professional.&nbsp;</p><p>Anderson is now a real estate broker and has worked for Berkshire Hathaway since 2017. As a real estate agent, there is little doubt she earns a respectable livelihood.&nbsp;Data suggests real estate agents in the United States make an average of $56.1k annually.</p><p>On the other hand, her alleged partner, Kevin Durant, is estimated to be worth over $200 million.&nbsp;This is unsurprising as his basketball career is full of accomplishments, just like former NBA star and living legend <a href=#>Magic Johnson</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZqOVq7avecOuqZqmpKh6uLXFnmY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bre-tiesi-gifts-nick-cannon-monopoly-parody-game-for-christmas-with-pics-of-all-12-of-his-kids.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bre Tiesi Gifts Nick Cannon Monopoly Parody Game For Christmas With Pics Of All 12 Of His Kids">&larr;

It took thirteen years for Brittanee Drexel's case to be resolved, and the "eureka" moment was from an unlikely party – the perpetrator. Police couldn't believe it when Raymond Moody turned himself in and confessed to it all. He detailed everything, demystifying the enigma that had confounded the force for over a decade. So, what happened to Brittanee Drexel?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/efb1281c0062389b.png><h2 class=table-of-contents__title>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h2><p class=align-left>It is a tragedy for someone you love to vanish, and getting no resolution from the investigators is an even bigger travesty. After 13 years of searching, Brittanee's parents still hoped to find their daughter. However, the sad reality struck in early May 2022 when someone gave a chilling confession. So, did they ever find out what happened to Brittanee Drexel?</p><h2 id=542195-who-was-brittanee-drexel class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Who was Brittanee Drexel?</h2><p class=align-left>Brittanee Drexel was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born in Rochester</a>, New York, on October 7, 1991. She was murdered on April 25, 2009, fifteen years ago. Her parents are John Kahyaooglu (of Turkish descent) and Dawn.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/82a1cc975b23f9ac.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Toddler Dies After Mother Left Her Home Alone to go on 10-Day Vacation</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Brittanee's mother later married Chad Drexel. Chad was in the military, and after his <a href=#>military services</a> ended, he moved his <a href=#>family</a> to the Rochester suburb.</p><p class=align-left>Brittanee was born with persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous in her right eye. The condition caused her to undergo various surgeries that resulted in the eye going blind. Therefore, she used contact lenses.</p><h2 id=542195-when-did-brittanee-drexel-disappear class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>When did Brittanee Drexel disappear?</h2><p class=align-left>Brittanee, just like other teenagers, was curious and wanted to explore. In April 2009, she asked her mother whether she could go to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, over spring break with her friends. Her mother disapproved of this trip as she didn’t want her teenage daughter going far away without the accompaniment of an adult.</p><p class=align-left>However, Brittanee still went, in the guise of staying at her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">friend’s house</a> for two days. Dawn wasn't alarmed when she called to inform her that she was at the beach, as she thought she referred to a beach along Lake Ontario's shoreline.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/477f4ebe0f5e4d70.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Grieving Lady Shares Last Chat with Boyfriend before He Died in KU Bus Accident: "We Shall Meet"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>That night, at around 8:00 pm, Brittanee left her friends and visited a friend at the Blue Water Resort. <a href=#>Security</a> cameras recorded her leaving at 8:45 pm. She even texted her boyfriend, John Grieco, around the same time. However, her texts stopped around 9:15 pm, and Brittanee Drexel’s boyfriend called her friends to find out what was happening.</p><p class=align-left>When they couldn't find her, they informed Brittanee's mother, who told the police, and still calls went unanswered.</p><h2 id=542195-the-investigation-and-search class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>The investigation and search</h2><p class=align-left>Police searched for Drexel the following morning and even viewed the security footage. The first person of interest was Peter Brozowitz, a 20-year-old nightclub promoter who was the last to see her before she left. However, after interviewing him and other people connected to Peter, the police didn't get any leads.</p><p class=align-left>Brittanee's mother even moved closer to where her daughter had disappeared to monitor the investigation's progress better. Dawn suspected that her daughter was a victim of human trafficking. However, the Myrtle Beach police didn't believe that she had been trafficked.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e3d21f9dbf40e384.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Viral This Week: Jowie's Mum Comforts Him After Sentencing, Kenyans Worried by Mary Atieno's Outfit</span></p></a><h2 id=542195-what-happened-to-brittanee-drexel class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>What happened to Brittanee Drexel</h2><p class=align-left>It took 13 years for something substantial to come up about Brittanee Drexel's update. Raymond Moody, a registered sex offender who spent 21 days in prison after a 1983 abduction case in California involving and 9-year-old girl, confessed to the crime of killing Brittanee.</p><p class=align-left>Interestingly, Moody had been pulled over for a traffic violation near Myrtle Beach a day after Brittanee Drexel disappeared. When he was pulled over, Raymond had scratches on his face. However, the police did not understand the connection until a decade later, when he confessed to the crime of murdering Brittanee.</p><p class=align-left>In early May 2022, Raymond Moody turned himself in to Georgetown Sherriff’s Office based on obstruction of justice. This was 13 years after Brittanee Drexel’s disappearance. Moody voluntarily spoke with investigators and gave complete details of what happened on that fateful day.</p><p class=align-left>Raymond stated that he and Angel spotted Brittanee leaving the hotel while driving and pulled over. They then asked her if she wanted to smoke with them (many have refuted this event), to which she complied, and they all rode back to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">couple’s campsite</a> by the Santee River pole yards north of McClellanville in Georgetown County.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e55526895dd0456c.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Violet Olinga: Body of Busia Girl Who Lay Unclaimed at KNH for 7 Months Finally Released</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After Angel left, Moody sexually assaulted Brittanee, killed and buried her.

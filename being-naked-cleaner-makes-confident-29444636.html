I’m clear I’m there just to clean, but they’ll say that other cleaners have been strippers or given massages.</p><p>"The money has definitely helped. I wouldn’t do it if I wasn’t being paid the financial incentive."</p><p>After dabbling in side-hustles like selling secondhand clothes, Lottie picked up her first job as a naked cleaner in October 2017 as a way to earn some extra cash.</p><p>Now she posts about her adventures on her Instagram account under the username @musings_from_a_naked_cleaner. She works in her local area, and she said she gets all sorts of different clients.</p><p>The role appealed to her as she wanted to earn more money while meeting new people, and trying new things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29422998.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_rdspapaya_334433810_234144282383317_1504877039824020764_Main.jpg><p>Her usual customers range from older men looking for company to younger guys with disposable income who want to "try something different". She said most of her clients are friendly and don’t overstep the mark, but sometimes people can take things too far.</p><p>"I’m always looking for ways to make extra money, and I quite like being naked, so I though ‘okay, I’ll try it’," said Lottie.</p><p>"The first job I was booked for I didn’t end up going. I freaked myself out after looking at the house on Google Maps, and seeing it backed onto woodland, and I was supposed to be there in the evening. But going forwards I thought ‘I can do this’ and started accepting jobs.</p><p>"I’ve met all sorts of people over the years. One of my clients I cleaned for three time altogether, and his house was the dirtiest house I’ve ever come across in my life, teeming with dirt and grime.</p><p>"But when I got there he didn’t want me to clean it at all. He wasn’t creepy or pervy – he just wanted some company."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Lottie doesn't wear gloves sometimes even though she knows she should. Sometimes houses can be "really dirty" so she's careful of where she stands, but most things don't seem to faze her.</p><p>One guy once put porn on while she was cleaning so she had to put the record straight. She said the people who are "slightly creepier" tend to have perfectly clean houses, and she often sees this as an indicator that it may be best to say no.</p><p>Lottie said: "I’ve cleaned for some younger guys who seem more sociable, they’re out and about and just have disposable income and want to try something different. Another guy I’ve worked with [for the whole six years] is a nudist, so to him it’s right up his street.</p><p>"He’s already naked when I get in, we have a coffee and I play with his dog and then get to work. The clients will get naked as well – a few of them are quite nervous at first and keep their clothes on until they’re confident enough to take them off."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29445020.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_SWNS_NAKED_CLEANER_003.jpg><p>Lottie admitted her family and friends know about her unusual career, and she thinks they wonder how she does it. They may have ideas that her customers are "weird and creepy", but she admitted most of them are really nice people.</p><p>The cleaner has also been in a few relationships, and she said people have been "cool" with what she does for a living. Lottie's current partner hasn't got an issue with her job, and she said it's "refreshing" to know a lot of his friends don't seem fazed by it either.</p><p><b><i>For more lifestyle stories you can sign up to the <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>free Hot Topics newsletter</a>.</i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKqVlrluuMifnGialZ67qHnNmqKenF2YuaatzZ6pZqWRoLK0ecKopZ%2BhlJq7tXmRcmttbGZogw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./productive-ways-kill-time-phone.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Productive Ways to Kill Time With Your Smartphone">&larr;

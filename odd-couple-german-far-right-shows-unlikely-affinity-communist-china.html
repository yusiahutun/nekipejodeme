The AfD has been widely criticised for echoing Russian propaganda throughout the war in Ukraine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s quite a young party, only 10 years old,” said Benjamin Hoehne, a professor of political science at the University of Munster who specialises in populist movements.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So it’s in a consolidation, institutionalisation and professionalisation process. There are competing wings, but we see a strong tendency that the far right wing within the AfD has captured the party as a whole.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On foreign policy, however, the self-anointed “most exciting right-wing party in all Europe” is making moves on an unlikely bedfellow: the world’s biggest Communist Party.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The AfD seems to be the most friendly German party to China,” said Gu Xuewu, the chair of international relations at the University of Bonn. “And Beijing might have realised it too.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">German spy chief warns of authoritarian states stoking anti-government mood</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a historic first, the AfD sent a high-ranking delegation to Beijing and Shanghai for a week-long visit in June. Lawmaker Peter Felser went on the trip and said it was “highly successful and positive”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We had the opportunity to talk to significant representatives of business, science and politics,” Felser said, while declining to name people the delegation met with.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The party headquarters did not respond to requests for a list of meetings. The Bundestag does not require detailed disclosures about who its members meet on foreign visits.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was particularly impressive to learn how well informed the people we met were about the situation in Germany and especially about the recent successes of our party,” Felser said. “We are looking forward to further developing these contacts.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/30/d56873e6-f141-4e6d-9fb5-108c35347cd2_609f6be3.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Also travelling were Alice Weidel, the AfD co-chair, and Peter Bystron, the party’s foreign policy spokesman.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A fluent Mandarin speaker, Weidel lived in China for six years, completing a doctoral thesis on the Chinese pension system and working as a Goldman Sachs and Bank of China economist.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her background, as part of the global financial elite the AfD typically rails against, jars with the traditional view of the German far right – as does her personal life.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Weidel lives in Switzerland in a civil partnership with a Sri Lankan-born woman and two adopted children. This does not stop her, however, from toeing the party line on social issues. She has opposed same-sex marriage and branded immigrants as “illiterate”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese state media did not report the AfD visit, suggesting it was not something the government wanted to publicly promote.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘No place for Nazis’: Germans march against racism, Islamophobia</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Perhaps the highest-profile nod the party has received in Chinese officialdom came from former deputy foreign minister Fu Ying, who criticised its absence from last year’s Munich Security Conference.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was not invited to the meeting, and even the Alternative for Germany party, which held a different position, was turned away<strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">.</strong> Such an arrangement made the meeting a place for one side to express its emotions and attitudes,” Fu wrote in The Paper, a state-affiliated newspaper based in Shanghai.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For the AfD, however, the trip was an important step towards securing international legitimacy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They’re getting something from China that they haven’t necessarily had before, except for Russia, which is international recognition,” said Katja Drinhausen, a scholar of China’s governance system at the Mercator Institute for China Studies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They’re being treated as not just equal [to the more established parties], but welcome representatives of Germany in a way that maybe many of them haven’t really experienced before.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Who is Prince Heinrich XIII, the ‘mad old man’ behind German coup plot?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beijing has, however, given the AfD ample airtime to promote views on German-China relations that closely align with its own.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Along with Mick Wallace and Clare Daly, two Irish members of the European Parliament’s Left Group, the most prominent MEP on Chinese propaganda organs is possibly Maximilian Krah, the AfD’s lead candidate for next year’s European elections.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They, too, are unlikely fellow travellers, but their alignment evokes a phenomenon known as the horseshoe theory, popularised by the French political philosopher Jean-Pierre Faye. It suggests that despite ostensibly coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum, the far left and right agree on many issues.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last year, in remarks that could easily have been made by either Wallace or Daly, Krah told the Global Times, a nationalist paper affiliated with People’s Daily, that “decoupling from China would serve only the interests of America and damage our own industry severely. This is not about democracy or human rights, it is about the future conflict between Washington and Beijing.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Earlier in the year, he told Guancha, a platform popular with Chinese nationalists, that the country should not “seek reconciliation” with the West on the issue of human rights.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/12/08/CLEAN.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:27</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Germany arrests 25 suspected far-right extremists for alleged plot to overthrow government</p><p>Germany arrests 25 suspected far-right extremists for alleged plot to overthrow government</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There are so many outstanding scholars in China, and I know you are studying the theories of the great German jurist Carl Schmitt. It seems to me that studying his views will lead you to the right conclusions,” said Krah, in remarks that would be unlikely to be echoed by the left, referring to the prominent Nazi who helped facilitate Hitler’s rise to power.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Krah did not respond to an interview request, but his views have upset some of the party rank and file.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I never joined the AfD to lick the boots of some Communist Party. That is, for me a total no go,” said Nicolaus Fest, an AfD member of the European Parliament. “I’m not a big fan of regimes from the other side of the political spectrum either.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The AfD’s surge in the polls comes amid soaring inflation, rising illegal immigration and political polarity that has deepened through the pandemic and Ukraine war, which has seen continental Europe take a bracing turn to the right.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other right-wing populists, such as Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Spain’s Vox Party, have criticised Beijing on issues from Taiwan to zero-Covid.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How climate change is helping to drive the rise of Germany’s far right</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The AfD stands out for its broadly pro-China stance. Experts and insiders suggest this is due to a mixture of economic factors and the magnetism of illiberal regimes to far-right thinkers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I would say there is a kind of fascination in the AfD towards non-democratic systems, to say it in a diplomatic way, because we can also see delegations and visits to Russia, of MPs from the Bundestag and state parliaments” said Hoehne, the academic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China may be Communist, but its world view appeals to some right-wing hardliners, said Drinhausen. “At its core, the Communist Party is conservative,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The hard leftists within China are in many ways much closer to European conservatives when it comes to top down governance, strong leaders in strong positions, putting the economy first, thinking about the collective good, having this nationalist streak, and being quite anti-woke and anti-individual,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So there’s in a sense politically more overlap between the AfD and the CCP than the Left Party and the CCP.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Italy’s PM Meloni seeks cooperation to curb flows of migrants to Europe</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Felser, the AfD lawmaker, said: “There is no left-right ‘conflation’ because in our view foreign policy and international trade should not be subject to ideology at all.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There are about 5,000 German medium-size enterprises actively engaged in China. For our nation, having positive economic relations with China is a matter of realism, pragmatism and national interest and not a question of moral attitude,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As for China, building a relationship with the fastest-growing party in Europe’s most powerful economy is an easy choice.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For the Chinese Communist Party, it doesn’t really matter if it is right or left, or black or white. They reach out to all parties across the political spectrum,” Drinhausen said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They cultivate contacts in the hopes that even fringe groups come to power one day, become the mainstream and make policies in their countries. And as it’s looking right now with the AfD that they have made a fairly good bet.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Xinlu Liang</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyltc%2BlpqaZk658or7TopqlnV9of3R%2Bl2xnaKeUmXqku9Spo55ll5q%2Frq3NZp2aql2ntqi002aqoaenqHq2usuiop6kqWKup7LIp6CtsV2YvK651KegrKxdmLWqusA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./live-nation-takes-over-at-l-a-s-historic-belasco-theatre.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Live Nation Takes Over At L.A.s Historic Belasco Theatre">&larr;

While their marriage may have been relatively short-lived, his life journey is closely tied to the world of music. His impact as a loving father and successful businessman leaves a lasting impression.&nbsp;</p><p>Following her death in April 2022, the famous American country singer’s first husband earned fans’ curiosity. Fans started asking, who is Naomi Judd’s first husband?</p><p>Here’s everything we know about Michael Ciminella, his early life, his marriage to Naomi Judd, his successful career, and his family ties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-08_01-28-14-fotor-2023080813725.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Michael_Ciminella></span>Who Is Michael Ciminella?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born in Ashland, Kentucky, Ciminella’s life began with roots deep in his hometown. Due to his cagey lifestyle, details about his elementary education remain unknown. However, after graduating from elementary school, the famous singer’s husband attended the Fork Union Military Academy for his high school education.&nbsp;</p><p>Afterward, he furthered his academic journey by pursuing a business degree at Transylvania University. He graduated from the University in 1967. In addition to his business degree, Michael Ciminella pursued an MBA at the University of California.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Michael_Ciminella_Do_for_a_Living></span>What Does Michael Ciminella Do for a Living?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After earning an MBA from the University of California, the singer’s ex-husband entered the corporate world. However, Michael Ciminella’s professional journey led him to thrive in sports production. As a Freelance Remote Sports Production professional, he lent his expertise to several networks, including NBC Sports, CBS, ABC, and ESPN.&nbsp;</p><p>After thriving in sports production, Ciminella followed in his father’s footsteps by exploring the business world. Shortly after entering the enterprise circle, Naomi Judd’s first husband became a business tycoon like his father. Consequently, he founded the Ashland Kentucky business, Ashland Aluminium Co.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-08_01-28-33-fotor-2023080813615.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Naomi_Judd_and_Michael_Ciminella_Meet></span>How Did Naomi Judd and Michael Ciminella Meet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to reports, Michael Ciminella and Judd shared a connection as classmates before love blossomed between them. The now-divorced couple embarked on their journey of love and commitment when Judd was just a few days shy of her 18th birthday in 1964. At the time, Judd was already pregnant with her first daughter, Wynonna, whom she had with her high school sweetheart and football player, Charles Jordan.</p><p>However, it didn’t faze Ciminella. After their wedding in 1964, the former couple moved to Los Angeles with Judd’s firstborn in 1968. On April 19, 1968, Michael Ciminella and his ex-wife welcomed their daughter, Ashley, adding to the joy of their young family.</p><p>Despite the initial happiness, their marriage faced challenges, and they decided to part ways in 1972. Naomi Judd’s career in the entertainment industry flourished after the divorce, and she became a notable figure. While Michael Ciminella didn’t follow in his ex-wife’s footsteps as a singer, their daughter Ashley pursued a career in the entertainment industry as an actress.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Naomi_Judds_First_Husband_Share_a_Close_Bond_With_His_Daughter></span>Does Naomi Judd’s First Husband Share a Close Bond With His Daughter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, he does. After his divorce from Judd, Michael Ciminella remained a devoted father to Ashley and maintained a close bond with her. He has consistently supported Ashley throughout her life, being by her side during challenging times.</p><p>One such time was when Ashley required surgery after an accident in South Africa. Upon hearing the news, Ciminella flew to be with his daughter and offered his love and support during her hospitalization.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-08_01-28-53-fotor-202308081358.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Has_Naomi_Judds_First_Husband_Remarried></span>Has Naomi Judd’s First Husband Remarried?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, he has. Following the end of his first marriage, Michael Ciminella took time to reevaluate his views on love and marriage. Eventually, he found love again with Mollie Whitelaw, a Louisville, Kentucky native. The couple tied the knot on November 8, 2010. After their wedding, Whitelaw pursued her education at Converse University.</p><p>She earned a Bachelor of Arts in Arts History, Fine and Studio Arts, Secondary Education, and Teaching from the University of Louisville. However, she now works as a Management Professional at an independent non-profit organization in Kentucky.</p><p>Similarly, Judd found love again after her divorce from Michael Ciminella. She met <a href=#>Larry Strickland</a> in 1979 and married him ten years later in 1989. Their marriage endured for an impressive 30 years before her unfortunate passing in April 2022.</p><p>While various chapters have marked Michael Ciminella’s life, each has contributed to his unique story. His brief time with Naomi Judd also left an impact, and he continued to shine as a devoted father and successful businessman.</p><p>Like Michael Ciminella, <a href=#>Alvin Martin, Whoopi Goldberg’s first husband</a>, is another celebrity spouse who lives under the radar after divorce.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqqvx5qcpWWTnrqqusSlo5plpJ2ybrbOrqmnnalivKd5zZqmpqFdn8KlsNJmnaKqo6l6qcHSm5innF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-consolation-prize-a-mocktail.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="the consolation prize (amocktail)">&larr;

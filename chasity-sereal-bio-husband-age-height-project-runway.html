Designers <a href=#>Coral Castillo</a>, <a href=#>Shantall Lacayo</a>, Chasity Sereal, and <a href=#>Kristina Kharlashkina</a> were left as the four finalists battling for the grand prize of $250,000 and the title of course.</p><p>Now meet one of these four women, Chasity Sereal with some serious chance to be crowned the winner.</p><h3><strong>Chasity Sereal On Project Runway</strong></h3><p>Chasity Sereal has always been a fan of the&nbsp;Project Runway. And sometime before her audition, she was trying to figure out her next steps. And so when even the finances were failing, she finally decided that she just had to boss up and do it. One thing that helped was she trusted herself for her competitive spirit and the determination to get things done.</p><p>So once she got chosen for the role, Chasity had no reason to not give the judges her very best. Chasity filmed this season of Project Runway during 2021’s spring and went in with a game plan, competing against what judge Nina Garcia calls, “the most talented group of designers we have ever had.”</p><p>So far, we can tell you that Chasity ended up in the bottom three during the season finale’s opener, and barely survived to reality TV live on to design for until the upcoming next week’s episode.</p><p>But even if she wins the show in the first place or not, Chasity still makes it to the elite group of local designers in Houston who have appeared on Project Runway.</p><h3><strong>Chasity Sereal Career</strong></h3><p>Today, Chasity Sereal proudly identifies as a full-time fashion designer and a part-time actress. But this certainly was not an easy journey. She went through countless hours of practice before she got painstakingly flawless in her craft.</p><p>Chasity taught herself the mechanics of design over YouTube considering the legendary designer Alexander McQueen as her inspiration. She began by making clothes for her Barbies out of socks and in 2009, she launched her namesake fashion line without any formal cutting or sewing experience.</p><p>To this date, her designs range from luxury streetwear to ready-to-wear couture. Her couture pieces are designed for strong, powerful women while also injecting “Disney Princess” silhouettes. (Chasity as a designer is infatuated with fairy tales.) Long gowns, structured suits, cocktail dresses, and billowing capes are just a few of her signature designs.</p><p>Not to miss, two of her collections were even shown at New York Fashion Week.</p><p>Chasity tells it’s her daughters who inspire her daily to keep creating beauty in the world.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Chasity Sereal Husband?</strong></h3><p>Chasity Sereal got engaged to Tirrel Jenkins on 28 July 2019. So, as of the time of this writing in Feb 2022, Tirrel is not yet her husband. As per her Facebook, the fiancé is from Detroit, Michigan, and is currently based in Houston, Texas.</p><p>Professionally, Tirrel is also into the same business industry as Chasity. He is a custom-made clothier/specialist working full-time at Houston’s Suitsupply&nbsp;since May 2018. Before that, he was a sales representative at Best Buy from 2012 to 2018.</p><p>From 2016 to 2017, Tirrel went to Champions School Of Real Estate for a 6-course program to receive his Real Estate license.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/chasity-sereal-bio-husband-age-height-project-runway-2022-1-300x243.jpg><p>As for his and Chasity’s relationship, they claim to be unstoppable together. And from the look of things, Tirrel is also the father of Chasity’s two daughters: Kirstyn and Kendall. But then likes of Twitter comments “Tryna give my daughter a better life than I had…..the only thing I can’t give her is a “father”. But she knows she’s loved :)” coming from Chasity indicates that he is not their biological father.</p><p>Having two daughters of her own, Chasity is fearlessly avid in creating a better life for her kids and ensuring that her two daughters will be motivated to follow their dreams.</p><h3><strong>Chasity Sereal Age</strong></h3><p>Because Chasity Sereal was born in 1990, she turned 31 in 2021.</p><h3><strong>Chasity Sereal Height</strong></h3><p>Not just talented but also beautiful Chasity Sereal stands 5’7” tall.</p><h3><strong>Is Chasity Sereal On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes.

of The Queen&nbsp;</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic>By Sam Greenhill for the Daily Mail&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Prince Harry was in mid air when Buckingham Palace announced the death of his beloved grandmother.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He flew by private jet from London, arriving at Balmoral an hour and a half after the historic statement.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Courtiers issued the declaration at 6.30pm – just over an hour after Prince William and other senior royals had arrived to join Prince Charles at the Queen’s residence.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But when the world was being told the saddest of news, Harry’s Cessna was still in the air, making its approach to Aberdeen Airport.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Duke of Sussex’s flight had been due to land at 6.29pm, a minute before the statement. But it was 20 minutes late taking off from London’s Luton Airport – with flight data showing it departed at 5.35pm. It took one hour and 11 minutes to reach Aberdeen.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By the time he landed, at 6.46pm, it was 16 minutes after the palace had made the announcement.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harry then faced a lonely drive to the castle, finally arriving at 7.52pm where he joined other members of the Royal Family in mourning the Queen’s death.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He looked ashen-faced on the back seat of the Range Rover as it swept into the Balmoral estate. As well as losing a beloved grandmother, he may have been reflecting on his future without her as monarch. She remained fond of him, in spite of recent challenges, and he was said to have retained an ability to make her laugh.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By the time he arrived, his and Meghan’s Archewell website homepage had been replaced with a respectful blacked-out page with the words: ‘In loving memory of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 1926-2022.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Earlier in the day there had been confusion over whether Meghan was also on her way to Scotland.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the morning, it appeared they were both intending to visit Her Majesty’s residence – until changing the plan so that Harry went alone.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As senior royals dashed to the bedside, a spokesman for the Sussexes was widely reported to have announced that Meghan and Harry were on their way.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The possibility raised eyebrows behind palace doors, given the recent strained relations between the Sussexes and senior royals.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meghan’s well-publicised accusations about racism in the Royal Family and alleging it did not support her in palace life overshadowed the Queen’s final days.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In contrast to the Sussexes, there was never any suggestion that the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge would go together.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While William hastened north, Kate remained in London, where she was seen taking their children to their first full day at their new school.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Senior royals including William are said to have been avoiding his brother and wife amid concerns any encounters could provide material for the Duke of Sussex’s forthcoming book.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Although they live in California, the Sussexes have been in Europe this week on a mini ‘royal’-style tour, including an event in Germany for the duke’s forthcoming Invictus Games.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Last night they had been due to attend the WellChild Awards in London, which honours the brave deeds of seriously ill children.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They were not scheduled to see the Queen at all during their trip to the UK, but decided to go to Balmoral on hearing about Her Majesty’s health, it was reported yesterday morning.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However by the afternoon, the plan suddenly experienced a dramatic U-turn, with Meghan apparently no longer coming. A spokesman for the couple was widely reported as saying Meghan would now remain in London, although would not attend the WellChild awards. It was said the duchess could potentially join Harry in Scotland at a later date.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harry and Meghan’s children Archie and Lilibet – named after the Queen – have stayed behind in the United States, and the couple were expected to return to them by the end of the week.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Earlier this week, one of the Sussexes’ favoured journalists claimed that Meghan and Harry still had not spoken to William and Kate, despite enjoying a day off from their tour, at Frogmore Cottage just 700 yards away from the latter pair’s Adelaide Cottage.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was claimed this week that William had resolved not to speak to Harry until after his memoirs are released, fearing their conversation would appear on its pages.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The brothers now face seeing a lot of each other as they prepare for the Queen’s funeral.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>&nbsp;</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>Even the royal household's staff were in tears yesterday, coming to terms with the loss of their much-loved boss, as well as the head of state.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One said: 'However much you try to prepare yourself for this moment, it just hits you like a ton of bricks. She is irreplaceable. I just can't believe we won't see that impish smile again. There is a deep sense of shock.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Queen's son Charles, the former Prince of Wales, is now King Charles III, while Prince William has inherited his father's title and is now, along with his wife, styled The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge. William is also now the 'heir apparent' to the British throne.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>All Her Majesty's children, as well as grandson Prince William, had rushed to Balmoral on Thursday after doctors became 'concerned' for her health. Buckingham Palace released a statement at 12.32pm saying the Queen’s doctors were ‘concerned’ for her health and recommended she remain under medical supervision while family members were informed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Charles was already at his mother’s side at her beloved Highland home after senior aides, fearing the worst, sent the Queen’s burgundy-liveried helicopter up from Windsor at 6.48am to collect him from Dumfries House in Ayrshire, where he had stayed the night after conducting several official engagements. He made it to Balmoral by 10.27am.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His wife, the Duchess of Cornwall – now Queen Consort, as Elizabeth II requested earlier this year – was already at Birkhall, the couple’s Scottish retreat, and was driven over by car to join him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is understood that the Queen’s daughter, Princess Anne, was already with her mother as she had been undertaking engagements in the area.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Staff hurriedly arranged for a jet to collect the Queen’s other children – Prince Edward, the Earl of Wessex, and Prince Andrew, the Duke of York – as well as the Countess of Wessex, whom the Queen adores and treats like a second daughter – and bring them up to Aberdeen.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her grandson, Prince William joined them. His wife Kate remained with their three children, who have recently started a new school.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The sombre family group arrived in Scotland at 4pm, sweeping through the gates at Balmoral in a Range Rover driven by William at 5.06pm. Although Buckingham Palace has not confirmed the time of death, it is thought that they were unable to see their much-loved matriarch before she died.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By coincidence the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – now sadly estranged from most family members – were in Britain from their home in California and due to undertake a charity engagement in London before flying back home to their children.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There was confusion when their spokesman initially said that both Harry and Meghan would fly up to Balmoral to join the family, which caused surprise as spouses would normally be unlikely to join close relatives at a time of personal grief.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But it was later confirmed that Harry would travel alone and he finally arrived at his grandmother’s home at 7.52pm. He was still in the air when the death was confirmed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Queen’s death was finally announced at 6.32pm in a short black-edged statement from Buckingham Palace which read simply: ‘The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon. The King and The Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Today Operation London Bridge will swing into action, the period of ten days between the Queen’s death and her state funeral, which is expected to take place on Monday September 19, as the country is plunged into a period of official mourning.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Queen’s coffin is expected to remain at Balmoral for at least the next two days before being flown back down to London next week.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But the pendulum to introduce His Majesty to his people will also begin to swing, with Charles and Camilla returning to London as King and Queen Consort today. He is expected to hold his Accession Council tomorrow.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Last night Miss Truss hosted a meeting of ministers, police and royal officials to discuss arrangements for the period of mourning leading up to the Queen’s funeral.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Union flag on Buckingham Palace was poignantly lowered to half-mast yesterday, while a framed plaque of the statement announcing the Queen’s death was placed on the front gates by royal household staff.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Royal Standard is never flown at half-mast, even after the Queen’s death, as there is always a monarch on the throne. Flags will fly at half-mast on UK Government buildings in tribute to the Queen from now until the morning after her funeral.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Queen's death will see Britain and her Commonwealth realms enter into a ten-day period of mourning as millions of her subjects in the UK and abroad come to terms with her passing.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A number of big events have already been cancelled, including the BBC's Proms and its famous crescendo, Last Night of the Proms, which were due to take place on Friday and Saturday.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Charles, who will reign as King Charles III, said yesterday: 'The death of my beloved mother, Her Majesty The Queen, is a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished sovereign and a much-loved mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'During this period of mourning and change, my family and I will be comforted and sustained by our knowledge of the respect and deep affection in which the Queen was so widely held.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Tributes yesterday poured in for Her Majesty, to many the greatest Briton in history and undoubtedly the most famous woman on earth. To billions around the world she was the very face of Britishness.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Liz Truss hailed the Queen, saying in a statement: 'Queen Elizabeth II was the rock on which modern Britain was built. Our country has grown and flourished under her reign.

those appearing on the Buckingham Palace balcony to working members of the Royal Family.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But King Charles' original model, which reportedly involved a tight core of just seven people, including himself, has been thrown into doubt following a series of external events.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The plan, put in motion before the Queen's death, originally

All day, we had known something was wrong. By mid-morning, rumours were circulating that she was very unwell.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Soon after, a statement from the palace. Her doctors were 'concerned for Her Majesty's health'. In the understated language of royal announcements, this was the&nbsp;equivalent of breaking the safety glass. Outside, the sky turned a menacing shade of grey: big, fat drops of rain, like tears, began to fall. A friend texted simply: 'I can't bear it. I'm just not ready.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It got worse.

So much will be different... even QCs become KCs&nbsp;</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>After 70 years on the throne, we have all become accustomed to seeing the Queen's image on everyday items such as bank notes, coins and stamps.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But following her death, they will have to be changed to feature portraits of the new King, Charles III.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>British currency won't be replaced overnight, however. It could take years, as new coins and notes are created with the face of the King and the older ones are gradually removed from circulation.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another change will be that while the Queen's image faces to the right on coins, new ones will show the King facing left. This is due to a tradition dating from the 17th century to alternate the way successive monarchs are facing. The Queen's coins did not appear until 1953 – the year after her accession.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The new coins and notes will need to be designed and minted, or printed. Then The Royal Mint advisory committee must send recommendations for new coins to the Chancellor and obtain royal approval. Designs are then chosen and the final choices approved by the Chancellor and then the King.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Stamps also depict an image of the Queen and new ones will have to be created featuring the face of the King, again with the current ones phased out gradually. Charles may have already sat for such sculptures or portraits, and he will again have to approve the designs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Royal Mail postboxes bearing the Queen's ER cypher (for 'Elizabeth Regina', the Latin for Queen) are unlikely to be removed – in fact, some emblazoned with the Queen's father King George VI's GR ('George Rex', Latin for King) cypher can still be seen today. But any new postboxes could feature the new King's emblem.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And in criminal court cases, the R to denote the Crown now stands for Rex rather than Regina. Another change in matters of law is that barristers and solicitors appointed by the monarch will see their title switch from Queen's Counsel (QC) to King's Counsel (KC).</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meanwhile, the words to the National Anthem now change to 'God save our gracious King'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Military medals featuring the Queen's effigy will need to be altered, while police and military uniforms bearing the Queen's cypher are likely to be updated over time with the new King's cypher – the monogram impressed on royal and state documents. The Queen's ERII features on traditional police helmets.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>UK passports will be issued in the new King's name and their wording changed at some point. Her Majesty's Passport Office will become His Majesty's Passport Office, as is the case with HM Armed Forces and HM Prison Service.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Charles's signature will also change. Before, it was simply 'Charles', but now it will be followed by an additional R for Rex at the end. As King, he will also need a new personal flag.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 1960, the Queen adopted a personal flag – a gold E with the royal crown surrounded by a chaplet of roses on a blue background – to be flown on any building, ship, car or aircraft in which she was staying or travelling. It was often used when she visited Commonwealth countries. While the Royal Standard represents the Sovereign and the United Kingdom, the Queen's own flag was personal to her alone.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meanwhile, the royal coat of arms, adopted at the start of Queen Victoria's reign in 1837, will remain the same. But just as when the Queen became monarch, it is likely that new artwork will be issued early in Charles's reign by the College of Arms for use by public service bodies such as the civil service and the armed forces.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 'very light rebranding' will be hard to spot, but it signifies the opportunity to replace old images, which have been in use for many decades, with newer differently stylised ones. And The Duke of Cambridge will be given an updated coat of arms when he is made the Prince of Wales – a title which he does not inherit automatically.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>&nbsp;</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_6 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>And then, the worst news of all: the Duke of Sussex was also heading to Scotland. Under the circumstances, and given the family's recent history, an indication of the true seriousness of the situation.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Finally, around 5pm, a friend from Aberdeen messaged to say that a piper had been summoned to Balmoral. That could mean only one thing. It seems unimaginable. Impossible. Just wrong. That wisest and most steadfast of women, our guiding light in the darkest of nights, has left. All feels black.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>How do we even begin to contemplate an existence without Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II? She has always been there, our comfort, our moral and (for many) religious compass through war, hardship, political turmoil, a global pandemic.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The one person whose face, whose smile, whose reassuring presence just always felt like home.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Stability, continuity, tradition in the finest sense of the word. This is a woman whose first prime minister was born in 1874. Not even my parents' generation has known a world without her. The story of her life, the changes she witnessed, how she steered the monarchy through seven extraordinary decades, could fill a library, and no doubt they will. She has been a model of duty and perseverance, everything a monarch should be.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But what made her so very special – and what makes her departure such agony – was her unique and enduring humanity.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Even as a young woman, she always demonstrated extraordinary emotional intelligence. She understood what it meant to be Queen, to wield that constitutional power; but she never let it go to her head, nor allowed the weight of responsibility to crush her irrepressible spirit.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Indeed, if anything, the longer she wore the crown, the closer she became to her people: kinder, more connected, more tangible, infinitely relatable.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She could put the whole nation at ease with a simple smile, she could touch our hearts with the smallest of gestures.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She was funny, kind, loving. She indulged her dogs and adored her horses. She lived her life with joy, despite the restraints of her position. And every now and then she allowed us a glimpse of the woman behind the throne.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That brilliant James Bond skit she did for the London Olympics; sharing a marmalade sandwich with Paddington Bear; giggling when things went wrong on sombre public occasions; her wicked talent for mimicry. She was, unlike so many royals these days, an undersharer; but what little we saw we could not help but love.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>My favourite story about her is that one about bumping into a group of American tourists near Balmoral. Not recognising the diminutive figure in front of them, they asked if she had ever met the Queen. 'No, but he has,' she replied, gesturing in the direction of the protection officer beside her.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She always carried the heaviest of burdens with the lightest of touches, and made it all look so easy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So much so that there was a small part of us – or certainly me – that thought she might live for ever, that she might by some miracle defy the laws of the universe. Some people make the world a better place simply by existing. She was one of them.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In truth, I'd been uneasy ever since I saw that photograph of her, earlier in the week, greeting her 15th prime minister. She looked elegant, of course – yet so terribly small and vulnerable.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>You could see she was doing her best to be her usual smiling self, no doubt aware of the importance of that moment for the woman standing in front of her: magnanimous as ever.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But something just wasn't quite right. I've only ever seen the Queen in the flesh once, in 2019, when I had the honour of finding myself inches away from her at a state banquet for the then-president of the United States, Donald Trump.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dressed in shimmering white and diamonds, her presence lit up the room. She radiated energy like the sun, eclipsing even the galactic ego of the president himself.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I watched in awe as she cut through the fawning throng, pausing briefly to give one of her equerries a gentle telling-off about some door that had been left open, causing a draught. While undeniably of an age, she seemed in vigorous health. Full of life – and full of more than a bit of mischief.</p><img id=i-e72c6438448b1234 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/09/08/23/62221603-11195117-Even_as_a_young_woman_she_always_demonstrated_extraordinary_emot-a-122_1662677274720.jpg height=753 width=962 alt="Even as a young woman, she always demonstrated extraordinary emotional intelligence.

The Queen is pictured during a 2006 visit to the Baltic States</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A lot has changed in three years. Primarily, of course, the death of Prince Philip, the man who was to her what she has always been for us: her rock, her constant, her guide in times of need.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was he who broke the news to her that she was now Queen while on tour in Kenya, following the death of her father George VI in February 1952. No one understood her sacrifice like he did. How must it have felt to guide the nation through the bleakest of Covid winters, to navigate the vicissitudes of Prince Andrew's conduct alone, without the duke's wise counsel. Not to mention the constant threats from her grandson, Prince Harry, and his wife.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>How she must have worried, alone in the wee small hours, about the future of the institution to which she had given her whole life, heart and soul, that she had fought so hard to protect and nurture.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And understandably so: for many Her Majesty was the only member of the Royal Family who was above criticism, immune to the day-to-day attacks on the monarchy, having earned the respect of even the monarchy's harshest critics. She was, in many ways, their super-power.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Without her, who knows what will become of them?</p><img id=i-e0e8763bab525907 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/09/08/23/62221593-11195349-A_few_moments_earlier_a_double_rainbow_had_appeared_over_Bucking-a-29_1662676210760.jpg height=642 width=962 alt="A few moments earlier, a double rainbow had appeared over Buckingham Palace, a glorious splash of colour in the grey afternoon sky (pictured)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span></span> <span></span><p class=imageCaption>A few moments earlier, a double rainbow had appeared over Buckingham Palace, a glorious splash of colour in the grey afternoon sky (pictured)</p><img id=i-df60889fade215c9 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/09/08/23/62222285-11195117-People_pay_their_respects_in_front_the_British_embassy_in_Berlin-a-123_1662677274725.jpg height=657 width=962 alt="People pay their respects in front the British embassy in Berlin, Germany following the death of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span></span> <span></span><p class=imageCaption>People pay their respects in front the British embassy in Berlin, Germany following the death of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As for the rest of us, well: the Queen has seen Britain through many of its bleakest hours. But the past few years have been especially turbulent and perplexing – and set against a depressing social and economic landscape.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She has been our one true north, the only fixed point in an ever-shifting world. As archaic as the monarchy is, in a funny way it feels like we've never needed it more, this institution that transcends the fortunes of passing prime ministers, led by a woman who, for seven glorious decades, has defied time and tide.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Being the highly perceptive person that she was, she must have known this. Which is perhaps why she kept going so bravely in the teeth of her grief and her failing health.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This year's Platinum Jubilee celebrations were as much for our benefit as for hers: an acknowledgment of the extraordinary bond between this single, small woman and a nation of almost 70million souls (and billions more if you count the Commonwealth).</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And however hard it will be now for us to face the future without her to guide us, however much we might wish she could have stayed just a little while longer, it is our duty now to honour her – and to let go with love.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She has carried us as far as she can. It is high time, now, for her to rest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Bcn2Yb21sa1%2BJtaZ5sK6cnqajYrCwssWipWaonJawprCMe5ilpZ%2Bnrq15wZqjpaqfpLpuv8eaqZ6cXai9pq%2FImqNmpZ%2Bisq%2FA0maHoaGcnr1vtNOmow%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./6-facts-know-about-ana-de-armas-who-stars-upcoming.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="6 facts to know about Ana de Armas, who stars in the upcoming James Bond movie No Time To Die">&larr;

Also, Kaleb is not known to have been married yet.</p><p>Although the pair seem unbothered by the gossip, they often talk about their decade-long friendship and how they came about sharing the same journey through a shared passion. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Origin of Wyse Guide</h2><p>Sharing the story of the creation of their YouTube channel and their lifelong friendship, the two passionately talked about their common interests, bringing them together as tight-knitted friends through&nbsp;in a video of 2014 uploaded in their YouTube channel,</p><p><strong>Kaleb Wyse and Joel talking about their friendship and their lifestyle showcased in their work (Source: YouTube)</strong></p><p>Joel said,</p><p>Kaleb and I met in college.

As of now, the YouTube channel, created in 2012, has accumulated 103 thousand subscribers as of 2021 with numerous guide videos on life on a farm. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-631 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-186 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Kaleb planting broccoli on his farm (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Commenting in their effort to inspire people to live a simple and soothing lifestyle connected&nbsp;with nature, Kaleb said,</p><p>Right now, we both really enjoy using the talents and skills that we have in these capacities.</p><p>Continuing to build a community through their wholesome content, Kaleb and Joel extended their ideas by creating a website, The Grey Boxwood, that further elaborates on their rural lifestyle. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-629 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>More On Kaleb</h2><p>Growing up on a farm in Iowa, Kaleb Wyse, age 33, saw life differently.</p><p>Miles away from the influence of city life, his inspiration for what he is doing today as a content creator comes from witnessing the way of life his family taught him since young.</p><p>After finishing his education at Mennonite High School, Kaleb joined Mennonite University with a degree in business. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-630 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Although he was expecting to have a career in business, working in the office crunching numbers, his journey took a different turn after he met Joel who helped Keleb take his passion for cooking and gardening to the next level.</p><p>With the intent of inspiring others with his way of life, Kaleb and his blogging partner Joel are making incredible progress with their inspiring content on YouTube and their website.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-native_bottom"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-653 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunC8jqSYpZ2SYsS6v8Rmn66rkpa7pXnPmqmtppWneq6t0augnpxencGuuA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./biggest-takeaways-quiet-on-set-bonus-episode.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Drake Bell, Apologies, Tokenism, Racism and More">&larr;

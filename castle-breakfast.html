And then I mix up a simple wholegrain soda bread but bake it as scones, so it can be done in 15 minutes. We use these minutes to pull out all the fruit left in the fridge and cut it up; fanning it out on a platter makes us feel fancy, and not like it’s the dregs that were left at the bottom of the produce drawer. If we’re feeling ambitious, we juice a couple oranges. If we have grapefruits, I loosen the sections of a few (I’m team grapefruit knife, not spoon, not that you asked) halves. I’ve been known to slice up pears and blue cheese with walnuts when the craving hits in the winter, and or apples with sharp cheddar in the fall. In the summer, it’s an abundance of berries or stone fruit or melon, sometimes with <a href=#>homemade ricotta</a> if I have it. If we have avocados, I like to slice them.* Then we nudge the kids to set the table, which always includes salted butter and apricot jam (my favorite), and, because I do not have any argument left in me by Saturday, Nutella and raspberry jam (everyone else’s).</p><p><span id=more-56663></span><br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/814a0a48-dd72-4ccc-afbd-1ebb53ca946d.jpg alt width=150 height=200 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1f149fdb-ad9f-4c96-9ef8-05aca45618ac.jpg alt width=150 height=200 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/7520dd56-9b50-4432-9221-4ac475af5cba.jpg alt width=150 height=200 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/c123a0f6-0586-4f00-a213-13e7d8c8bfe5.jpg alt width=150 height=200 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/5b955a7d-2325-45cf-88a4-464571da0c80.jpg alt width=150 height=200 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/94ef321c-a5b6-4193-beb6-750e8a7bbce2.jpg alt width=150 height=200 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/113f4e27-f4ef-4b1b-96a3-3ad0ae0f9165.jpg alt width=150 height=200 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/e5d8c735-f110-4d48-b613-b74311e34048.jpg alt width=150 height=200 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>We call it Castle Breakfast and we started this weekend ritual a few years ago when we stayed at a couple castles-turned-hotels in <a href=#>Ireland</a>. I love fancy hotel breakfasts; the teapots and civility, the sunny rooms, the little jars of jam, the fresh fruit, so ideal for grazers like me. And I realized I wanted this very much to be part of every weekend, something to look forward to after the cold cereal and rushed mornings during the week. But only if I could do it in, like, 30 minutes tops. I’m neither a domestic goddess nor a morning person, although I bet they often come in the same package.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/51914518236_507073529b_n.jpg alt="castle breakfast-01" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/51914841194_bb0ac327eb_n.jpg alt="castle breakfast-02" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/51914616028_cb3f1b47e2_n.jpg alt="castle breakfast-03" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/51914616223_8fffc143cc_n.jpg alt="castle breakfast-04" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>When we came back from Ireland, I began my soda bread studies and I could go on and on but suffice it to say that some are darker, some are lighter, some are poured into loaf pans, some are baked as boule/rounds and I love them all. But when it came to my weekend breakfasts, the simplicity of the traditional formula* we’d learned taking a class at Ballymaloe Cookery School best suited my needs. It’s just flour, baking soda, salt, and buttermilk. I swap half the white flour with coarse wholemeal (whole wheat) flour (more about this in a moment). I like that we’re getting a dose of whole grains in the morning and don’t need it to be sweet since they’re going to slather it with sweet stuff regardless. It’s also absolutely perfect with a pat of salted butter. We do not make these in advance. They’re fine the next day, I guess, if rewarmed. But they’re best right out of the oven, so why deny ourselves?</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/51913554737_6a2e492fc8_z.jpg alt="castle breakfast-07" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>If we’re not making brown bread scones, I’m making <a href=#>pancakes</a>, <a href=#>crepes</a>, <a href=#>dutch babies</a>, or one of two recipes I owe you: popovers or a new waffle. This is because Castle Breakfast isn’t as much a recipe as it’s a philosophy. It’s about making days off feel special, about feeling as calm and doted on at home as you would in a fancy tearoom. It’s about feeling a tiny bit royalty, regardless of budget. I hope it feels good.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/51914519086_885bfac6f5_z.jpg alt="castle breakfast-08" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h5>A few things:</h5><p><b>Ukraine</b> I do not need to tell you how devastating the news is out of Ukraine right now. I’m forever inspired by the work of World Central Kitchen, who gets on the ground as soon as possible when there are humanitarian or environmental catastrophes anywhere in the world, set up mobile kitchens, and make sure people get hot meals, which we all understand the essentialness of. They’ve been on the ground at different border border points feeding those fleeing Ukraine for the last week and I wish it wasn’t necessary, but I am proud to support their work. [They also have a <a href=#>Charity Navigator</a> rating of 100.] I set up fundraisers last weekend through the Smitten Kitchen Facebook and Instagram pages [who charge no processing fees and do not hold the money before dispersing it], hoping we might raise $5000 but I magnificently underestimated the kindness and generosity of SK readers. We’ve currently raised a combined $343K, and I am humbled and overwhelmed, watching this climb. These SK fundraisers run for another 3 weeks, should this sound like the kind of charity you, too, would like to support, but you can give through their website indefinitely, of course.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine wholemeal flour (see Note up top for swap; see Note at end for description), all-purpose flour, salt and baking soda in a large bowl, whisking to combine. Pour buttermilk over dry ingredients, then coarsely grate butter over the buttermilk. Stir to combine into a thick, somewhat gloppy mass, slightly damper than your average scone dough. If it doesn’t come together, add more buttermilk, 1 tablespoon at time, until . (I need at least 2 extra tablespoons when using a thick brand of buttermilk.)<p>Dollop dough in four big mounds on prepared baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes, until just lightly golden brown at edges and dry to the touch. Eat right away, split in half and spread with butter, jam, or chocolate.</p><p>Sleepy Deb Method: Use a 1/2-cup measure (twice) to measure the 1 cup each of wholemeal and all-purpose flour. Use it again (twice) to measure 1 cup buttermilk. Use it again, still wet from the buttermilk, as a scoop to loosely shape the four scones into pucks. The leftover buttermilk in the cup makes it easier to shake out the scone. 😉</p><p><strong>Let’s talk about coarse wholemeal (whole wheat) flour:</strong> The magic ingredient in most wholegrain or brown soda breads is Irish wholemeal flour. Irish wholemeal flour is coarse and gritty, high in fiber, and has a wonderful nutty flavor. It is not the same as our whole wheat flours here, which are milled fine and smooth, and I do not like the result when I use them as a full swap. Although I think I’ve come up with a solid copycat, it requires extra ingredients, which likely takes this out of the running for an easy breakfast baked good for others. Here’s my advice: If you find you like these scones and want to make them more often, you could mix up a jar of my Irish flour swap and have it at the ready for your weekend mornings. Or, you could splurge on a bag of the imported flour. Prices range significantly (blame a supply chain crisis) but even when it’s overpriced, it is amortized over 56 scones, i.e. my favorite way to justify things. Here are some places you can find the <a href=#>Odlums</a> brand I use online: <a href=#>Amazon</a>, <a href=#>Food Ireland</a>, <a href=#>Mercato</a>. It comes in Coarse and Extra-Coarse; both work. Note: I know that King Arthur Flour also makes an <a href=#>Irish-style flour</a> but it was out of stock when I was working on this recipe so I wasn’t able to test it. If it’s coarsely milled, you’ll be set.</p><p>[* Want to add butter, sugar, raisins, or caraway seeds?

'Anything can happen!'" Elordi sarcastically quipped. "And obviously anything can happen, but at this stage in my life, I don't see myself having any interest in that. I like to make what I would watch, and I get very restless watching those movies."</p><p>While he was clear that he wasn't knocking any actor who would do a superhero movie or even the movies themselves, Elordi simply said that those types of roles just aren't for him.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/dc/4by3/2023/11/13/dc83061714c04ef88364eec90c8c4fd6_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Jack Bridgland/GQ</span><p>He continued, "Well, they asked me to read for Superman. That was immediately, 'No, thank you.' That's too much. That's too dark for me."</p><p>While touching on his acting future, Elordi also looked back on the earlier days of his career, with the 26-year-old Australian-born actor reflecting on the "miserable" experience of graduating from teen-movie idol to a serious actor.</p><p>"I didn't want to make those movies before I made those movies," Elordi said of <a href=#><strong>the </strong><strong>Kissing Booth</strong><strong> saga</strong></a>, in which he played highschool heartthrob, Noah Flynn. "Those movies are ridiculous. They're not universal. They're an escape."</p><p>Speaking on the "one for them, one for me" ethos that can be fairly commonplace in Hollywood, Elordi called it a "trap."</p><p>"Because it can become 15 for them, none for you. You have no original ideas and you’re dead inside," he explained. "So it's a fine dance. My 'one for them,' I've done it."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>As for his latest role in Priscilla, the Sophia Coppola-directed project told through the perspective of Elvis' ex-wife, Priscilla Presley, Elordi called taking on the role of the "King" exciting, particularly after the Elvis mania that followed with Austin Butler's Oscar-nominated portrayal of the music icon last year.</p><p>"It certainly crossed my mind briefly before I'd read the script. I don't want to tell the same story over, especially because he did such a fine job of portraying this man," Elordi shared. "It's a completely different thing. And it's terribly exciting, too, running into the fire a little bit. I can't think of anything more exhilarating."</p><p>He even got Priscilla's approval, telling the outlet, "She said I got the voice right, which was everything I needed to get."</p><p>While his dreams of becoming a bona fide movie star are undoubtedly coming true, there are still some trappings of fame Elordi is getting used to -- including some of the more gimmicky asks that come while promoting a film, like a video premise in which he's blindfolded and being fed certain foods and having to put on a show trying to guess what the food is.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:bc618b71-f3c7-4695-925e-43fa0e9258c8 data-container-ref=toofab:article:73956cc2-9746-423f-853b-a32600b7c3fd data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/41/5by4/2023/06/21/4146fb34342041a485e9999abfade6ed_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">A24</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Priscilla Trailer: Euphoria's Jacob Elordi Transforms Into Elvis for Biopic from Priscilla's POV</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"And you’re a grown f--king man! That stuff's embarrassing," he exclaimed. "Then, also, you watch me choke on a banana with a blindfold on. How will you believe me when it's 1943 and I'm in a prisoner of war camp doing surgery on somebody? 'I just saw him with a banana halfway down his throat on f--king YouTube.'"</p><p>The upside? All the free stuff he gets just for being him.</p><p>"I never bought a bag," Elordi said. "Maybe that should be something that is exposed about Hollywood. All these people think, 'I wish I had that lifestyle.' I mean, yes, to get them for free -- that's great. What a great lifestyle. But people that have all this money aren't spending it. You just get sent stuff. It blows my mind."</p><a id=gallery-link-017f852e-5cc1-4afc-899e-3f77c4f54b9d class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:017f852e-5cc1-4afc-899e-3f77c4f54b9d data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:73956cc2-9746-423f-853b-a32600b7c3fd data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1b/4by3/2023/11/13/1b0b43aa88744c4db8ff2cd46c9897ad_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmamtfn66ku8FmnKWnopm2brfIrKqippdir7C706FkpqemnrK0ecSlraKrXaeyp8HSoqWgZaOqvaa%2BzJqlaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nick-cannon-says-mariah-carey-still-mad-at-him-for-giving-this-gift-to-their-twins.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nick Cannon Says Ex Mariah Carey Is 'Still Mad' At Him For Giving This Gift To Their Twins">&larr;

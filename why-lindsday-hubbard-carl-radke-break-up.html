The show followed the cast as they shared, fought, drank, and partied in a house in Montauk, Long Island, over the summer. In season two, four cast members left the series, as&nbsp;Summer House&nbsp;added Amanda Batula (Kyle’s girlfriend), Danielle Olivera (Carl’s ex) and Amit Neuman. Season 3 saw the additions of Hannah Berner, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paige DeSorbo</a> and Jordan Verroi, while season 4 added Jules Daoud and Luke Gulbranson.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1257369662.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1244815694.jpg><p>Hubbard and Radke got together in the show’s fourth season but called it quits. Even though their romance was over (for now), they formed a special friendship. Ahead of season six, Hubbard and Radke&nbsp;sparked speculation that they had romantically reunited, which they later confirmed to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Us Weekly</a>. “I’m happy to report, we are dating and things are really good,” Radke said January 2022. “We’re very happy. She’s someone that’s been an incredible support and part of my life [for years]. … I mean, we make each other laugh like crazy. I’ve never felt more myself around someone than her. And for me, that’s powerful.” But after all their ups and downs, their relationship has come to an end once more. Here’s why <a href=# id=auto-tag_lindsay-hubbard data-tag=lindsay-hubbard>Lindsay Hubbard</a> and <a href=# id=auto-tag_carl-radke data-tag=carl-radke>Carl Radke</a> broke up.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=why-did-lindsay-hubbard-and-carl-radke-break-up>Why did Lindsay Hubbard and Carl Radke break up?</h2><p>Why did Lindsay Hubbard and Carl Radke break up? Though the two have said things about the breakup, the exact reason is still not known, though there have been hints they simply grew apart. While there were rumors that cheating could’ve been involved, Carl maintains that there wasn’t.</p><p>“We were engaged. We were getting married. We had a date set. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>I didn’t cheat on Lindsay</a>. I did not have an affair,” Carl told Rolling Stone in November 2023, comparing the frenzy to that of Tom Sandoval and Ariana Madix, who broke up after Tom’s cheating was revealed.</p><p>“I feel like our relationship was just in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>a different space than Sandoval</a>’s was but at the same time, because it’s <a href=# id=auto-tag_bravo data-tag=bravo>Bravo</a>, I do think there’s a huge appetite for another scandal.”&nbsp;He continued: “I hope people also realize on the other side of the scandal are human beings, people who are going through something in real-time, and that’s very, very emotionally difficult. You have a lot of people weighing in about false or not truthful things going on in that situation.”</p><p>On September 14, 2023, Lindsay Hubbard posted a statement on<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/CxLYhX0u74_/?img_index=1"> Instagram </a>about how she reacted to the breakup. Here’s it in its entirety:</p><p>“I would like to start by saying thank you for allowing me the space and time to process my emotions, heal, and grieve the loss of not only my relationship, but my friendship with someone I considered my best friend for 8 years.</p><p>The last 2 weeks have been the most heartbreaking and emotional weeks of my life. My entire life and future was ripped out from underneath me and I’ve had a hard time making sense of it all – with no answers or closure on why. I feel humiliated by how it went down, and simultaneously heartbroken that it happened in the first place. My trust has been betrayed, and coming to terms with that has been difficult for me.</p><p>This was not my decision, and I do not agree with quitting a relationship (at this level) without trying everything possible first. I have spent the last couple of weeks finding my own closure and peace. I am forever grateful to my best friends who have not left my side, and have been picking up the pieces of my heart and life every day from the fallout.</p><p>I am still grieving and trying to process all that has happened, but I felt it was important to update you all. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for the love and support from my friends, family, cast mates, and all of you for carrying me through.”</p><p>Carl wrote in an email to wedding guests before her statement came out. “Words cannot possibly express how difficult the last two weeks have been for Lindsay and I” and apologized “for the confusion and lack of communication” on their split.</p><p>Carl wrote, “The fact of the matter is Lindsay is devastated and I’m crushed with how all this transpired. I graciously ask for some patience and grace to heal and recover while we navigate this extremely difficult time.”</p><p>“We were left trying to figure out how this all exactly happened before we could even have the opportunity to determine the path forward amongst ourselves,” he continued. “Sadly at this time we are not moving forward with the wedding. The fact of the matter is Lindsay is devastated and I’m crushed with how all this transpired,” before calling the drama “a mess.”</p><p>Queens of Bravo—considered the equivalent of the celebrity gossip queen DeuxMoi but for Bravo—tweeted that the split was “his idea” and they even talked about it on camera. “We’re hearing they discussed it ON CAMERA and it was his idea,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>they said</a>. “From source said: ‘She had no idea it was coming’.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1257369662.jpg><p>Indeed, according to a source quoted in <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Us Weekly</a>, Hubbard was “blindsided” by Radke’s decision to end it and she’s still trying to process it. “It’s all so raw,” the insider said. “The dust hasn’t settled with it yet.” They continued: “He did call off the wedding on camera,” the source confirmed, adding that it was “so mean” for Radke to break up with her so publicly.</p><p>Their split was revealed on August 31, 2023. “Carl Radke and Lindsay Hubbard have called off their engagement. The two were set to get married in November, but Carl told Lindsay he couldn’t move forward with the wedding. The breakup was filmed and will most likely play out on the next season of Summer House,” multiple&nbsp;sources told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>ET</a>, the first outlet to break the news.</p><p>On November 1, 2023, Us Weekly talked to Hubbard about her split. She recalled that “every couple has&nbsp;normal arguments, but nothing that would’ve been so drastic as to break up. It was literally the last two weeks of summer that his demeanor and tone changed. There was a lot of combativeness and aggression on his end, and I was very confused.”</p><p>She also remembered the exact instance when they broke up. “It was absolutely humiliating. It would’ve been one thing if this conversation happened over the summer during the normal filming schedule. But for [Carl] to call up producers and then set up cameras and manipulate me into sitting down [so he could break up with me] after we’d already wrapped is scary. The whole world found out within 30 minutes of me.”</p><p>She also clarified that no one on the cast saw the breakup coming. No one saw it coming, not one person,” she told the outlet. “There were no red flags. Two weeks before he called it off, I was at my bridal shower and he showed up. One week before, I was at my dress fitting and he was fitting for his suits with all of his groomsmen. It had nothing to do with wedding planning. There was no cheating.”</p><p>In August 2022, Hubbard and Radke revealed their engagement to the world through a series of snaps posted to Instagram. Their joint post was captioned, “YOOOOOOO 💍 #AThousandTimesYes,” signaling their excitement and commitment to each other. The proposal took place on the scenic Dune Beach in Southampton, New York, and the moment was made even more special as it was captured by Summer House cameras.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>People</a>, the elaborate proposal had been a well-kept secret. “As we got there, I told her, ‘We haven’t had time to have alone time this summer, and I wanted to do something special,’ “Radke said. “And I had the ring in a beach bag that she was carrying that I snuck in there. And she turned her back, and I figured, ‘This is my chance’ and I grabbed the ring, got down on one knee, and I turned her around and told her I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, how happy I was, and that our love story was just beginning.”</p><p>She recalled: “He said, ‘Will you marry me?’ and I said, ‘A thousand times, yes!'” Hubbard gushes. “And he said, ‘Hold on, let me get the ring’ and I was like, ‘I don’t care! When should we get married? Now? I’m ready!'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Hubbard previously told StyleCaster about how she came to be on the reality TV show. “Five or six years ago, when the creators were developing a show about a group of friends going from New York to the Hamptons during the summertime. They basically met Kyle and at that point in time, we had an extended group of friends that reached into the 100 mark. Kyle basically gets cast and is like, ‘You need to come to one of our group parties.’ The creators came to our big party of us in one space and were like, ‘Holy moly. We just hit the jackpot!’ We kind of fell into it in the beginning. It made sense. I’m going to go out to the Hamptons anyway, why not just throw a camera on us?”</p><p>On how she felt about cast members who put in “more effort” than others when cleaning, she said: “I wish I could say I was surprised that some people put in more effort than others, but I’m not. We’ve shared a house for a long time and there’s a core group of people who do more of the heavy lifting. Every single season, it has to be talked about, and we do talk about it every season.”</p><p>She continued: “If it weren’t for the Kyle and Carl and Lindsay and Danielle and Luke of the group, nothing would be getting done. You have to step up. That’s what happens in real life. I don’t know if it’s so much as an age difference as much as it’s the idea of fending for yourself and being independent. I’ve been financially and every type of independent since a very young age. Others have been cared for and nurtured more through their 20s than some of us, who have been doing everything for ourselves.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lWxocWpjZMSpxYyloKeco5muunnHrpmbmaKZeqSt0aVkq5mUoLJurtGemKRlpaV8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./beyonce-sheer-lace-bodysuit-train-japan-8636523.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Beyonc Wore Sheer Lace Bodysuit and Thigh-High Boots">&larr;

What’s her ethnicity? Does she have a boyfriend? Who are her family members?</p><p>Read all about her in this article here.</p><h3><strong>Meet Emaza Dilan, Jason Derulo Accusor</strong></h3><p>Emaza Dilan, an aspiring singer, and Jason Derulo will be seeing the established singer in the court. She reportedly filed a sexual harassment complaint against Jason, alleging that the R&B singer signed her to a record deal with the intent to have sex with her. PageSix reported this.</p><p>“I have anxiety; I’m traumatized,” Emaza told NBC News. “I’ve dealt with inhumane work situations. … I’m at this point where I’m back to zero and I have nothing.”</p><p>In the lawsuit acquired by Page Six, the musician—who describes herself as a “humanitarian” and “activist” on Instagram—suggests that Derulo made unwanted sexual attempts toward her after they started cooperating professionally. The “Talk Dirty” singer allegedly urged her to make a mixtape in four months and an album in six after they first met in August 2021. Dilan eager to launch her own career did so, believing it was a “no-brainer” to do so.</p><p>The singer claims in the lawsuit that when she was dating Derulo, he frequently invited her out for drinks, but she turned down his invitations in order to “keep their relationship professional.” Gibson reports that after she refused invitations to events where alcohol would be served, the “Swalla” singer began bringing alcohol to their recording sessions. The singer claims that at a recording session in September 2021, she was allegedly given “inappropriately large amounts of alcohol” and felt “pressure” to consume it.</p><p>Additionally, she asserts that cocaine and other drugs were occasionally available and that Jason Derulo allegedly requested her to participate in “goat skin and fish scales,” which she took to refer to a sex rite. According to Gibson’s lawsuit, the “Watcha Say?” singer was in “explicit demand for sex-in-exchange-for-success.” She also claims that Derulo has acted aggressively in the past, citing an incident that occurred in November 2021 as an example.</p><p>Emaza asserts in the lawsuit that at the time she was introduced to Rosa, whom she saw as an example of how her career may advance should she sleep with Jason Derulo. When Gibson informed his manager, Frank Harris, of Rosa’s appearance, the “Savage Love” singer allegedly “lost control and started violently hitting his armrests,” according to the court documents. Derulo allegedly lost his cool once more in June 2022 after Dilan arrived late for a recording session at his Malibu, California, residence.</p><p>“I had to step back … my hand just clutched my chest, because I was, like, I’ve, I’ve never been approached this way by anybody,” the “Wiggle” singer allegedly “charged” at the singer when she arrived, the singer told NBC News.</p><p>Emaza Dilan’s record deal was reportedly terminated after that incident on Sept. 6, 2022.</p><p>“I’m just trying to fight for what’s right because what was done to me was not OK. And I wouldn’t want anybody else to go through what I went through. They wasted my time. They promised me things. … ‘Forget the contract.’ That’s what I was told. But if I wasn’t going to do, if I wasn’t doing my part according to this contract, I would be in trouble. I would be held accountable,” said Emaza.</p><p>Emaza, who is suing for contract breach, illegal retaliatory termination, and intimidation, said NBC News.</p><p>Jason hasn’t responded to any of the allegations yet.</p><h3><strong>Emaza Dilan Age</strong></h3><p>Emaza Dilan is 25 years old as of 2023. Her birthday is in 1998.</p><h3><strong>Emaza Dilan Family</strong></h3><p>Emaza Dilan has spoken of her family on multiple occasions. Her mom is named Sandra Bales, a Creative Director in California.</p><p>The singer said “My family will always be the ones that ride for each other. I have a 10-year-old baby sister I gotta think about. I have a 17-year-old brother I gotta think about I have a stepdad who’s helped raise us. It sucks when you have a support system and you want to turn on them, versus the people doing you dirty.”</p><p>Emaza claims to be a mama’s girl. Her mom was born “on the bathroom floor in a third-world country in the Philippines, and she was able to get her daughters signed to Roc Nation.” She adds that she does “everything and anything.”</p><p>Emaza shared that her father abused her mom. She credited her mom for getting the family out of that situation.</p><p>“Growing up in Iowa, that was like our outlet. My father was abusive, so when we were going through that transition and getting ready to leave for California, it was just a place to be ourselves,” Emaza confided in Girls United.</p><p>The singer added, “Every step of the way, my mom said ‘What do you want to do with your life? How can I help you? How are we gonna solve it? I’ma take care of my daughters.’ ”</p><p>Emaza grew up in a musical environment where her mother Sandra played everything in her collection, from country to hip-hop and R&B. This exposure to a wide range of music helped to shape Emaza’s current artistic style.</p><p>On Mother’s Day 2023, Emaza wished her mom, “HAPPY MOTHER’S DAY MOMMY 😍💖 THANK YOU&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>@yslbeauty</a>&nbsp;for the amazing gift 🎁💋&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#libre</a>&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#EmazaApproved</a>&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#emaza</a>&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#emazadilan</a>.”</p><p>Her one sister is Saiyr and Znuie Gibson.</p><p>Emaza’s mother saw the vision for a girl group consisting of herself, Saiyr, and their sister Znuie and made the decision to move full-throttle into entertainment.

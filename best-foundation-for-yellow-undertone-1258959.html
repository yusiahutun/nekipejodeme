If you're all about that dewy, fresh look, this is your jam. The coverage is full-on, but it feels surprisingly lightweight – like my skin can still breathe. I went for the Fruit Pigment Color in Warm 7.0 with yellow undertones for my dark skin, and it's a total win. No weird cakiness or that mask feeling, just a natural glow. And can we talk about the moisturizing concealer? It's like a magic wand under my eyes. Goodbye, tired look! The finish is just right – not too matte, not too shiny. So, if you have normal to dry skin, this combo is a game-changer. Plus, it's got that pure water vibe – feels clean and good for the skin. All in all, it is definitely my new go-to for a flawless, hydrated face.</p><p>Pros</p><ul class=pros_list><li>Climate pledge friendly</li><li>Vegan</li><li>Great for dry skin</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul class=cons_list><li>Not great coverage</li></ul><li class="product_info_li border_bottom" readability=0><p>6</p><p>Best Natural Looking Finish</p><a href=# rel=sponsored title="Ellis Faas Skin Veil Foundation" onclick='triggerGA("Pv_Select","Article_Product_title","Ellis Faas Skin Veil Foundation","-"),triggerBuyNow("select_buy_now",&#39;&#39;,"1258959","2023-11-17 10:05:13","Product Description","Article_page","/select/best-foundation-for-yellow-undertone-1258959","Select","Beauty","B07937D396","Ellis Faas Skin Veil Foundation","6","Product Title")' readability=2><p><h3>Ellis Faas Skin Veil Foundation</h3></p></a><a href=# rel=sponsored title="Ellis Faas Skin Veil Foundation" onclick='triggerGA("Pv_Select","Article_Product_Image","Ellis Faas Skin Veil Foundation","-")'><img original-src=https://www.pinkvilla.com/english/images/2023/11/1700195876_41k0btsq2kl-_sl1100_.jpg alt="Ellis Faas Skin Veil Foundation" title="Ellis Faas Skin Veil Foundation" width=auto height=auto onclick='triggerBuyNow("select_buy_now",&#39;&#39;,"1258959","2023-11-17 10:05:13","Product Description","Article_page","/select/best-foundation-for-yellow-undertone-1258959","Select","Beauty","B07937D396","Ellis Faas Skin Veil Foundation","6","Product Image")' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-11/1700195876_41k0btsq2kl-_sl1100_.jpg></a></li><p>I'm kind of obsessed with this foundation for yellow undertones from Ellis Faas.

They have been very supportive of Kari competing on The Voice season 22.</p><p>Brayden performed “This Town” by Nial Horgan at The Voice auditions, but only one chair turned. But judge Blake Shelton’s chair turn was the one he needed the most. After that, he performed “Pretty Heart” by Parker McCollum for the battle round, “Mercey” by Brett Young for the knockout rounds, “Buy Dirt” by Jordan Davis and Luke Bryan for the top-16, “Come Over” by Kenny Chesney for the top-10, and “Homesick” by Kane Brown for the top-8.</p><p>According to the singer, “Homesick” was the perfect song choice for him that week. “This is a song I can kind of relate to, being out here all this time and missing home. This is a perfect song because I’m definitely missing my friends. Missing my family. I’m 16 and this is like, the longest I’ve been away from home,” he said at the time.</p><p>And the judges wholeheartedly concur. Coach Gwen Stefani remarked, “That chorus fit you like a glove.” “It is actually watching you blossom vocally and aesthetically in front of our eyes,” Blake continued. Brayden would likely grow to be way too huge, according to the judge, for them to ever be invited back to the show.</p><p>On The Voice, Brayden’s fellow competitors Parijita Bastola (Team Legend), Rowan Grace, Justin Aaron, Kim Cruse (Team Legend), Bryce Leatherwood, Kique (Team Gwen), Morgan Myles (Team Camila), Bodie, and Omar Jose Cardona all made it to the top 10.

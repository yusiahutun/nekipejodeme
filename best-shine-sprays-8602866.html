We were not blessed with naturally shiny hair, and we rely on these stylers to <strong>coat our hair with a generous layer of luminosity</strong>. “Shine sprays <strong>make your hair look healthier</strong> because of the reflection of the light,” explains Raven Hurtado, stylist at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Maxine Salon</a> in Chicago. “They also make <strong>hair color look more vibrant</strong>.” The trick, though, is to find the best shine spray for your hair type and texture —&nbsp;because not all hair can handle the same formulas.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-color-wow-extra-shine-spray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>COLOR WOW Extra Shine Spray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon COLOR WOW Extra Shine Spray" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mUtP-OMDxyuPRbMK_FKiWQ2zDyk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/color-wow-extra-shine-spray-520a426434d6489390cd41c0c48bddec.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This formula is featherlight and works well for most textures.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>This mist has a fragrance that may be too strong for some.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This is my number one favorite —&nbsp;it’s a game changer,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Brandi Voorhees</a>, stylist at Sharon Dorram Color at Sally Hershberger Salon. Extra Mist-ical features mullein flower extract, which grabs onto UV light, blocking hair from its damaging rays, and then converts it into full-spectrum light for <strong>hair that truly sparkles</strong>. “It goes on <strong>nice and light</strong>, and doesn’t get too greasy or too heavy,” says Voorhees. “It’s the perfect finishing spray for most styles to <strong>add some shine and brightness</strong>.” This spray also features <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2><strong>heat-protecting qualities</strong></a>, adds Hurtado. “Because of this, you can use it before blow drying or apply on dry hair for an extra glossy finish,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you are sensitive to scent, keep in mind this product is <strong>heavily fragranced</strong>, with some likening the aroma to vanilla cake.

Once you’ve finished styling, you’ll<strong> </strong>see<strong> super glossy hair</strong>. It boasts <strong>impressive frizz-fighting benefits</strong>, keeping hair silky in extreme conditions (including the American South in summer). We also like the <strong>subtle coconut scent</strong>, which doesn’t linger after styling.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is very nitpicky, but we’d prefer it if this product was packaged differently. The <strong>bottle has a broad and boxy shape</strong> — while this may look stylish on your vanity, it’s not very functional.

The complex fragrance smells <strong>sweet and fruity</strong>, but in a sophisticated (and not saccharine) way. As it <strong>coats hair with glassy shine</strong>, it also <strong>protects against frizz</strong>, keeping strands looking smooth and polished. This formula is also one of the most lightweight shine sprays we’ve tested — it doesn’t feature any oils, so there's <strong>no greasy residue</strong>, even on very fine hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because there aren’t any oils, this <strong>shine spray isn’t nourishing</strong>. Those with dry or coarse strands may find that the formula could leave their hair a little parched.

Vitamin B5 and camelina oil coat strands to <strong>help strengthen</strong> while adding <strong>glossy luminosity </strong>and treating brittle ends. If your hair is heavily processed, you’ll love how this shine spray <strong>makes hair look salon fresh with a few spritzes</strong>.

It can also make oil-prone strands look greasy even faster if you apply too much. You can avoid this by concentrating your application to the mid-lengths and ends of your hair, which will give you the shine-boosting, frizz-taming benefits without overdoing it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Vitamin B5, camelina oil｜<strong>Color-Safe: </strong>Yes｜<strong>Benefits: </strong>Controls frizz and flyaways, moisturizes｜<strong>Size: </strong>4.4 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-blonde-hair-kenra-professional-shine-spray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Blonde Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kenra Professional Shine Spray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ulta Kenra Professional Shine Spray" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3XEFq-Afx93j6gLUIaI5jVB-B2g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kenra-professional-shine-spray-10a871d0c2164c26a876d1b7aba3f5b7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This acts like a topcoat to restore shine to dull and lifeless strands.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>Overdoing it can weigh down fine hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your blonde comes courtesy of the salon, you know that lifting your natural color can come at the price of dryness and dullness, especially if you’ve gone platinum.

Instead, it <strong>makes curls pop</strong>, even if you’re on day three of a wash-and-go style. It also has a <strong>light and pleasant floral scent</strong>, likely due to the inclusion of plumeria.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this is one of the best formulas for curly hair on the market, the <strong>nozzle is problematic</strong>.

This iconic formula from Aveda <strong>keeps hair in place while delivering dazzling shine</strong>. Though it offers effective medium control, it <strong>doesn’t deposit any crunchy or sticky feel</strong>, and brushes out easily when you want to reset your style. This formula also <strong>defends your hair from humidity</strong>, making it a staple of any summer haircare routine — and many people love the fragrance, which comes courtesy of essential oils, including clove, jasmine, and rose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This product is packaged in a <strong>non-aerosol bottle</strong>, which may be a plus for some.

This product’s <strong>unique purple tint combats warm tones </strong>to keep grey hair looking cleaner, whiter, and brighter.

These textures can handle heavier ingredients without getting greasy — in fact, they need them. “​​Thicker hair needs heavier ingredients to keep the hair manageable and help with frizz,” says Hurtado.<p>If you’re applying a shine spray after styling to tame your hair, you’ll want to avoid a finishing product that’s wet or water based, says Voorhees. “This can mess up your finished style, especially if your texture is curly and you’re going with a straight, sleek look."</p></li><li readability=3.8789473684211>&nbsp;<strong>Ingredients</strong>: “Look for a line that has healthy ingredients and not too many chemicals,” says Aguirre, who adds that sulfates and parabens are super drying and should be avoided. Look for ingredients that add shine, condition hair, and protect it from free radical damage, like plant-based oils — argan, jojoba, and castor oils. “It is a good idea to use a shine spray that has moisturizing properties because hair that lacks luster often is a bit dry,” says Friese.<p>“Just be mindful of heavy oils in a shine spray to prevent buildup on your scalp, hair, or skin,” says Chamarti.&nbsp;Keep in mind that not all hair textures can easily handle plant oils; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>fine or thin hair types</a> in particular should avoid oil-based formulas to prevent a greasy look.</p></li><li readability=4><strong>Additional Benefits</strong>:<strong> </strong>It makes sense that shine sprays really focus on adding shine to hair and tend not to have many other benefits. That said, sometimes you’ll find formulas with moisturizing and frizz-control properties, which are especially useful for those with dry and textured hair types.<p>However, there are also shine products that double as a heat protectant — “It’s always beneficial to avoid damage and splitting ends,” says Voorhees — or UV protectants, which Friese notes are ideal if you spend time in the sun.&nbsp;</p></li><li readability=5><strong>Application</strong>: If you’re starting from wet hair, Voorhees recommends starting with a small amount of product, working it into your mid-lengths and ends, then blow drying or air drying as you normally do.&nbsp;For hair that's already dried and styled, it’s best to mist on a small amount, holding the bottle a few inches away from your head, says Hurtado.<p>Those with thin or fine hair should go slow and steady. "Start by spraying lightly, you can always add more if needed,” says Friese. If your hair gets very oily or greasy very quickly, you may want to take it a step further and "spray the product into your hands first" before working it through carefully to avoid oversaturation."</p></li><li readability=6><strong>Your Hair Routine</strong>:<strong> </strong>While shine spray can certainly help make hair look glossier, “it can only do so much,” says Aguirre, who notes that to have truly shiny hair, you’ll need to look at your entire hair care routine as a whole. “Your diet will affect your hair as well.”<p>When overhauling your regimen, determine what your hair needs. If your hair is dull because it’s dry, seek out more moisturizing shampoo and conditioning formulas. It could also be lacking because of product buildup, in which case, you’ll want to get yourself a clarifying shampoo and occasionally treat yourself to scalp exfoliating treatments.&nbsp;<br></p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the difference between glass hair and liquid hair?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Friese, the glass hair look is a “sleek hairstyle with a high-gloss, mirror-like finish.” On the other hand, liquid hair is just as reflective and glossy (if not more so) as glass hair, but the overall finished look is fluid and flowy, giving hair body and movement. To achieve either one of these ultra-shiny finishes, you’ll have to blow your hair out straight, then do a thorough pass around your head with a flatiron for an extra-smooth look. The last step is a generous mist of your favorite shine spray.</p><p>Keep in mind that your hair color will affect how glassy your hair looks: “Darker hair will be shinier than lighter hair,” says Chamarti. Blonde hair absorbs light, while dark strands reflect it.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do you use shine spray on wet or dry hair?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you apply shine spray depends on what style you’re trying to create and the type of shine spray you’re using. The packaging of your chosen formula will tell you how best to use it.</p><p>However, most shine sprays are used as a final touch. “Finishing shine sprays are applied after the style is dry,” says Voorhees. “Finishing shine spray is similar to hairspray, but lighter and has less hold; it will prevent frizz, and leave your hair with a silky, touchable finish.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is shine spray the same as hairspray?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Generally not. The entire goal of using a hairspray is to control or hold a style in place. “Shine spray typically doesn't have any hold,” explains Hurtado. “Some hair sprays do enhance shine.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How can I add shine to my dull hair?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Your entire hair regimen —&nbsp;shine spray included —&nbsp;contributes to your strands’ shine, from your shampoo and conditioner to your hot tools. In most cases, hair needs more moisture to shine. "You can also use a clarifying shampoo to remove buildup and oils from the scalp [and hair],” says Hurtado. You’ll also want to go to the salon. Chamarti recommends getting a haircut, which will clean up compromised and dull ends, as well as a professional gloss treatment.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“But not all hair textures are going to be shiny with just a good hair care routine,” warns Friese. “Some need more help than that.” That help can include nutrition. If you’re not getting the vitamins and nutrients your body needs to function (or if you have a deficiency), that can negatively impact your hair. Consider scheduling an appointment with your primary care provider, naturopath, or trichologist to get to the root cause of your dull hair if switching up your routine doesn’t improve things.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Will shine spray make my hair look greasy?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It certainly can, especially if you apply too much. Both Chamarti and Voorhees recommend starting with a small amount and applying more as needed. “Apply mostly, if not only, at the ends of hair,” adds Chamarti. Hair can be shinier closer to the roots as that’s where your scalp’s oils are; the ends of your hair can be drier and thus duller.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emily Orofino</a> is a writer and consultant with nearly 15 years of experience in the beauty industry.

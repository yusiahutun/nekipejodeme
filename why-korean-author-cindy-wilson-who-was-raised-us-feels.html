She said she considers her adoptive parents, not birth parents, to be her true family. Raised in Mississippi, Wilson identifies as being part of the African-American community even though she is Asian.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">8 Korean hallyu actresses who helped make K-drama a global success</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a recent interview, she spoke about her upbringing, how it has affected her journey to find her true self and her book which was published in 2018.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">You appear to be more outgoing and positive than the other adoptees I've interviewed. Could you please tell me about your upbringing?</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One thing I've learned since meeting other Korean adoptees is that all of our experiences are different. It has been interesting hearing about the trauma of some Korean adoptees. As human beings we all experience and process things differently, but I do think that my upbringing had a lot to do with my outlook on life. I was very involved in different activities and was a cheerleader from high school through college, so that definitely helped to shape me as an outgoing person.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I think that my mum was that example of being strong, confident and fearless, so it allowed me to see that as a woman of colour, although I am not African-American like my mother, that I could also overcome adversities. I also am a huge proponent of therapy and self-care, and have been going since I was in my twenties and am definitely still a work in progress, but I for sure put in the work.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">BTS to join Lady Gaga and the Obamas in YouTube celebration of graduates</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">In an interview, you mentioned that America became racially divided in 2016, and this prompted you to publish the book.</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I was speaking about the election of [US] President [Donald] Trump, and I do believe our country is divided more so now than ever. I cannot speak to President Trump's intention, but I do think there are moments when he either blatantly or indirectly empowers certain groups and overlooks others, which causes divide. I am a huge believer in inclusivity but I think that even with [US] President [Barack] Obama, he allowed for certain groups of people to finally feel included, which is great, but resulted in others feeling excluded. I think there is a lot of work, in which we all play a part, in order for us to have a more united America.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">How did your readers react to your book?</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I have loved the responses, reviews and messages that people send to me about my book! A lot of people have different things in the book that they relate to and it has really made an impact on them, [such as] being different and not being accepted, being bullied, people wanting to put them in a box of who they should be based on how they look and family issues. It validates the reason why I wrote my book and that is to let others know that as extreme as my situation may be, they are not alone.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Why doesnâ€™t K-pop star Taeyang have any friends?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">In the book, you said you took a DNA test.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/05/22/5bce3c5e-9bd1-11ea-96ff-7aff439fc3be_972x_181448.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I did take a 23andMe DNA test. I speak about it in my book and how nervous I was to get the results back. Growing up everyone always called me Chinese, which is not a bad thing, but that wasn't who I was. So when I took the test I wondered what my reaction would be if it came back anything other than Korean, which I was told my entire life. Luckily it did come back that I was 87 per cent Korean and I believe 9 to 10 per cent Japanese, so that was interesting. Being an adoptee and not knowing your family history or background, you are seeing a lot of us take the DNA tests for some sort of validation. That was my initial reason but I had to remind myself that the results wouldn't change who I am as a person but maybe my journey.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Hi Bye, Mama!: why are K-drama fans freaking out about a boy playing a girl?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">You said you are an Asian but your culture is black. When I heard about this, I was thinking about the 1992 LA riots and alleged tensions between Korean-Americans and African-Americans back then. Twenty-eight years have passed since the tragic incident. I am wondering if there has been any progress. Do you have any plan to play a bridging role between the two ethnic groups?</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I can only speak to this personally because I was raised and lived in the South so I am not sure about other areas in America. From what I have noticed, Korean-Americans and African-Americans are still pretty segregated. I would say in the younger generation you may see more interaction but the more traditional generation, maybe not so much. Also, since I have been doing interviews I have had a lot of people comment or send me messages to help bridge the divide between the two groups from a more educational perspective of African-Americans and how they are treated by Asians. Most recently in the news we are seeing African-Americans being discriminated against and physically harmed by some Asians overseas during Covid-19, so I would say that would be a huge indicator that there is a lot of work to be done in bringing those two groups together. It is unfortunate because being exposed to both groups, they have more in common than not.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Many adoptees are looking for their birth parents. Whenever I asked why, almost all answered that they wanted to ask their birth parents why they gave them up. Is this the case for you, too?</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I hear that often when I meet other Korean adoptees. It is interesting because that has never been a strong desire for me. I think ideally I would like to see other people that look like me because we share the same DNA, but then what? I always question the bond I would have with them and if a language barrier would make it more complicated so I've just never strongly pursued it. Plus, I've always looked at my family that adopted me as my family so there is no strong urge or sense of missing something for me. Not to say that I wouldn't feel that later in life and I have contemplated it more since meeting other Korean adoptees, so who knows?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Want more stories like this?

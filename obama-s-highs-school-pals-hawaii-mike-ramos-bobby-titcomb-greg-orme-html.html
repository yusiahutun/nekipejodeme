Franklin D. Roosevelt made frequent trips back to Hyde Park, N.Y., throwing picnics or barbecues for former neighbors and friends, and George H.W. Bush remained pals with men he served with in World War II.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In the second term, presidents have often sought refuge from the pressure by disappearing into nature to fish or hunt, said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. But such solitude has become less and less attainable for presidents in modern times.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Many people call Obama aloof, and he hasn't made a lot of friends in Washington,' Brinkley said. 'When you're president, everybody wants something from you and only these types of friends are able to simply want your well-being. They have a different level of affection for you than friends you meet later in life.'&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2FeYWQcGpxZ3%2BXrq6tjKxkoaGXncBuv8KhpqikXaWurb%2BMgZiwmZmeeo61yp5ki5mdpMBujs6bmbJlhJ7BpLvMm2SAqpWcepC%2BzJ5loaydoQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./serial-killer-admits-murdering-girl-15-burning-body-police-chief-fired-response-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Serial killer admits murdering girl, 15, and burning her body as police chief is fired over response">&larr;

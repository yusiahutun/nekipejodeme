However, some online content claims to be genuine and has gained credibility from various sources backing them up. One popular video that someone unknown uploaded online in the early 2000s was the Blank Room Soup. The video is creepy and watching it leaves you with more questions than answers. So was the footage actual? And what does the Blank Room Soup video mean?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e9586a185d5d835e.jpeg><p class=align-left>The dark web is a part of the deep web that contains content not meant for the surface web. It primarily houses illegal websites selling dr*gs, weapons, and stolen information and is not regulated. With such a haven, it is no surprise that criminals use the platform to conduct their dirty deeds.</p><p class=align-left>However, sometimes content uploaded on the dark web finds its way to the surface web, which is accessible to the general public. One such video that went viral in the mid-2000s was the Blank Room Soup. It is creepy, and many have tried to debunk it but to no avail.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8af0af086944015f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of Catfish stars who died and their causes of death</span></p></a><h2>What is the Blank Room Soup video?</h2><p class=align-left>A creepy video <a href=#>surfaced on YouTube</a> in 2005 featuring a man in distress in an empty white room. The man seems to be undergoing mental torture as he cries, and two mysterious masked men are confronting him.</p><p class=align-left>The video features two parts, almost one minute in length. It features an Asian man who seems naked in apron-like clothing, seated at a large table in an empty white room and eating something from a bowl. The clip gets even weirder when you notice he uses a comically oversized spoon.</p><p class=align-left>A person donning a RayRay character suit enters the room from behind and starts to stroke the man soothingly, something that seems to distress the man further. You then see a second RayRay character appear and begin massaging the man on the table. This rubbing gesture makes the man finally break into hysterics and fits of tears.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/544bad48a42792ec.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Will Willis from Forged in Fire?

The RayRay characters appear at the door behind him, watching him hurl and struggle to eat. They finally rush him, and the video ends abruptly.</p><p class=align-left>If you have watched the video, you can attest to how creepy it is. But is the clip real, or is it just acting? And what is the story behind the Blank Room Soup video?</p><h2>What does the Blank Room Soup video mean?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8af0af086944015f.jpeg><p class=align-left>There are various explanations for the footage, but all of them are just theories. YouTubers first found the clip in 2005 on YouTube, uploaded by an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">anonymous person</a> named "renaissancemen". In addition, the original Blank Room Soup on YouTube wasn't Blank Room Soup but a freaky soup guy. The description on the video read, "We don't know what this is".</p><p class=align-left>According to legend, the figures in the costumes <a href=#>kidnapped the man</a> and his wife, starved him, and served him soup made from the remains of his wife, whom they also killed. That was why he was crying and appeared to be about to vomit. That was why the figures patted his back; they were torturing him, mockingly sympathising with him as they forced-fed him the cannibalised remains of someone he loved.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4d89567e78ab0719.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of top 10 most toxic fandoms in the world as of 2022</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, this myth is one of many theories surrounding the video. There is no proof that the details explained are valid, but it is the most convincing among the theories. In addition, the claim that people discovered the video on the deep web is unverified.</p><h2>Blank Room Soup theories</h2><p class=align-left>There are various Blank Room Soup theories surrounding the video. The Raymond S Persi Blank Room Soup theory claims that Persi made the video and uploaded it online as a hoax.</p><p class=align-left>However, the artist had refuted these claims stating that weeks before he received the video in his email, someone had stolen two RayRay suits in an RV serving as a wardrobe during a tour of Los Angeles. He claimed after receiving the video, he uploaded it to YouTube to share it with his crew members, but the video went viral.</p><p class=align-left>In 2015, YouTuber <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ReignBot investigated</a> by contacting Raymond Persi. Persi told her via email the story of his missing suits and how they later appeared in the Blank Room Soup video.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1a2bcfb03ed26fff.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan TV adverts: The top 20 greatest commercials of all time</span></p></a><p class=align-left>ReignBot also discovered that the channel that first uploaded the video belonged to Persi. Eventually, Reign couldn't debunk the video as there needed to be more credible information to work with.</p><p class=align-left>The other theory, made by YouTuber SuperHorrorBro, claimed that the video originated from the dark web. In his debunking, the content creator claims that a person known as E Nigma contacted a hacker responsible for stealing the RayRay suits.</p><p class=align-left>According to Nigma, the hacker sent him an email in which they explained their motive for the theft. The hackers wrote a lengthy statement about how capitalism corrupts art, and in stealing the suits, they freed Ray Ray via the magic of art from the <a href=#>corruption of capitalism</a>.</p><p class=align-left>In <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his theory</a>, SuperHorrorBro supports the narrative that the man and his wife were hostages. He explains in his video that the man had undergone torture and was force-fed remains of his wife.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/56b57511c8b74b1b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 meanest celebrities in real-life according to fans</span></p></a><h2>Blank Room Soup explanation</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/544bad48a42792ec.jpeg><p class=align-left>The video uploaded nearly 18 years ago still has never received a valid explanation. Horror fans have tried their best, but all have ended up failing. However, based on the various theories available, there could be an explanation for the video.</p><li>The first explanation is that the original narrative was true, the suits disappeared, and someone else made the video.</li><li>The second explanation could be that hackers were responsible for the video and that they did it to prove a point is actual. The story of the hackers is partially accurate but with other details made up.</li><li>It could be that Raymond S. Persi made the whole thing up as a hoax and that people bought into it.</li><p class=align-left>Whichever explanation you choose to believe, one thing is clear, this video surpassed its intended purpose of frightening viewers and being creepy.</p><p class=align-left>The Blank Room Soup video is one of the internet's craziest uploads. People who watched the clip were left horrified and puzzled about what happened. Some YouTubers tried to debunk the footage by researching and contacting Persi, but all met a dead end or more theories. Unfortunately, viewers speculate whether the footage is actual or just a perfect hoax.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/819d5fb99a2cb0a3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Borat: 10 fun facts about the movie.

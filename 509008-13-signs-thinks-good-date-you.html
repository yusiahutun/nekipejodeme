During the initial stages of your relationship, everything may seem perfect, but as time passes, he may portray warning signs he thinks you're not good enough. It is always important to detect them early and make an informed decision about the future of your relationship.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/71490336a21ff098.jpg><p class=align-left>Questioning whether your partner thinks you're good enough for them is an unsettling experience. Why should you pay attention to his behaviours and actions towards you? They will indicate if he values you or if he thinks you're not good enough for him.</p><p class=align-left>It is also essential to be aware of some warning common signs that may mean he doesn't see you as an excellent match to avoid settling into a toxic relationship.</p><h2>Common signs he thinks you're not good enough for him to date you</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/76c4bd74a2ebd903.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>8 signs your husband misses his affair partner after ending it</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Knowing your partner's thoughts, especially regarding the relationship, might be challenging. Nevertheless, he may portray some common signs that prove you're no longer a good match for him.</p><p class=align-left>These clues show that it's time to have an honest conversation. You should reflect on your feelings to consider whether the relationship aligns with your goals and needs.</p><h3>1. He doesn't make time for you or prioritise spending time together</h3><p class=align-left>If your partner doesn't make an effort to spend time with you, is always on his phone, or seems bored in any conversation you have, it could be a sign that they don't value the relationship as much as you do.</p><p class=align-left>A healthy relationship requires effort, time, and sacrifices from both partners. So it may mean time to reevaluate the relationship if he isn't willing to make an effort.</p><h3>2. He doesn't show affection</h3><p class=align-left>Physical affection, such as kissing and holding hands, is a critical part of any <a href=#>romantic relationship</a>. And if he isn't comfortably affectionate with you, no matter the situation, it could be a sign that he doesn't regard you as a valuable partner.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9b1b8a636b616304.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Signs of unspoken attraction between coworkers to notice</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Do you express your desire for more physical affection, but your partner still doesn't make an effort? Then it may be time to move on because it is one of the signs he thinks you're not good enough.</p><h3>3. You can't remember when he last said he loves you</h3><p class=align-left>This is an obvious sign that he is no longer interested in you. Imagine telling him you love him, and he responds by saying â€˜Thank You". Hurts, right? You may fail to understand that erratic behaviour, but what's obvious is that he doesn't acknowledge his love for you anymore.</p><p class=align-left>If you can't recall him saying he loves you from his heart, be sure that you will also forget why you fell in love with him in time. And who wants that?</p><h3>4. He doesn't introduce you to his family or friends</h3><p class=align-left>Does he love hanging out with his friends and has never attempted to introduce you? <a href=#>Family</a>, relatives, and friends are the most important people in anyone's life, and if your partner isn't willing to introduce you to them, it could be a sign that they don't picture a long-term future with you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/afce4b1d7a65c4d3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ funny questions to ask a guy to make him laugh out loud</span></p></a><p class=align-left>While he may possibly have valid reasons for not introducing you, it's critical for you to have an<a href=#> open conversation</a> about his genuine intentions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/76c4bd74a2ebd903.jpg><h3>5. He doesn't respect your opinions or values</h3><p class=align-left>Do you feel like every opinion you have is an obsolete waste because your partner either dismisses it or talks over you? Then there is a high probability he neither cares about you nor your opinions.</p><p class=align-left>In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's thoughts, opinions, and feelings, even if they don't always agree. If he dismisses your thoughts, it could be a warning sign that they don't see you as an equal partner.</p><h3>6. He belittles, constantly insults, or criticises you</h3><p class=align-left>Criticism is a normal part of every relationship. But if your partner constantly mocks or insults your thoughts and actions, it could be one of the signs he thinks you're not good enough.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dc7c9f1e0989562c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ spiritual captions for Instagram photos about peace and love</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A partner who genuinely values you and your relationship will offer constructive criticism and support your growth. If he sees a future with you, he will not be condescending towards you or make you feel horrible about your looks or beliefs.</p><h3>7. He compares you to other women and praises them</h3><p class=align-left>A partner who is unhappy and doesn't regard you as a good match makes you feel like you're not as attractive as other women in his life. Comparing you to other women or reminiscing about his ex in unhealthy ways is a sign of insecurity and a lack of respect for your individuality.</p><p class=align-left>It is a vivid sign you are not important to him. It's time you realise you deserve a <a href=#>loving partner </a>who sees value in you.</p><h3>8. He has no interest in resolving arguments/conflicts</h3><p class=align-left>A person who values you and your relationship will want to compromise and work things out in case of a conflict. This is a clear sign of a healthy relationship and his willingness to be with you in the future. If he doesn't try to understand your point of view, then it's a sign that he sees you as a liability and is willing to walk all over.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/aaad724b82a2fce8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to ask someone to be your boyfriend without sounding weird</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If he doesn't try to understand your perspectives, even if he doesn't agree, it means he doesn't see the need to make amends with someone he can't see a future with. This is one of the signs he thinks you're not good enough.</p><h3>9. He tells you that you're not good enough for him</h3><p class=align-left>If your partner is outright telling you that you're not good enough for them, it's a clear sign that they don't appreciate you in their life. If he constantly pretends that he doesn't realise he is hurting you by saying this, you are in an unhealthy relationship where you are not valued.</p><p class=align-left>At such a point, choose yourself and know that you deserve someone who sees you as a valuable partner because when a man tells you that you are not good enough, you better run.</p><h3>10. You are emotionally drained from running a rat race to please him</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs20o0f5mb4ci.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ weird questions to ask your boyfriend just for fun</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If you are constantly trying to do something to make him happy through words or actions, but you feel like nothing is ever enough, then you need to find a healthy relationship.</p><p class=align-left>An unhappy partner will always find fault in everything you do, making you feel drained mentally and emotionally. If you find the need to please him, but he ends up making you feel not good enough, then he doesn't value you.</p><h3>11. He doesn't support your goals or aspirations</h3><p class=align-left>A partner who truly values you will support you in your aspirations, even if they don't always understand or agree with them. If your partner isn't willing to support your passion and interests, it could be among the signs he thinks you're out of his league and thus doesn't see a future with you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9b1b8a636b616304.jpg><h3>12. He doesn't take your feelings into consideration</h3><p class=align-left>Imagine being in a relationship with someone who doesn't think of you or how you will feel when he is about to do something that will affect you and your relationship.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3c0db0eb1738cf46.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 different ways to say you're welcome professionally or casually</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If you are in such a toxic relationship, you will always cry from his negative words or actions towards you. If your partner constantly disregards your feelings, it is among common signs he doesn't value you and may not be emotionally invested in the relationship.</p><h3>13. He speaks negatively about you or puts you down</h3><p class=align-left>If your partner thinks you are not important, he will negatively speak about you to his friends, put you down in public, or corrects you incessantly. If you feel your partner judging you for every mistake, it's a sign of disrespect and a lack of consideration for your feelings. Ensure you communicate your feelings if he is not treating you with respect.</p><p class=align-left>The above are signs he thinks you're not good enough. When you have invested your feelings in a relationship, you may not notice some of them, making you spend your entire life chasing validation. That's why you need some insights to avoid a broken heart.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/179a71272e2b2899.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ save the date quotes for a wedding: Best, funny, and cute ideas</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke published a guide on how to <a href=#>tell your wife you want a divorce</a> in a gentle way.

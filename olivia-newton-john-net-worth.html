Newton-John played Sandy Olsson in 1978’s Grease. With John Trvolta as Sandy’s boyfriend Danny Zuko, the film made over $341 million worldwide. After 13 years, the film shattered the live-action musical record set by The Sound of Music. Grease held the record for 20 years until Les Misérables broke it in 2012. Grease is seventh-highest-grossing live-action musical with inflation. Newton-John’s “Hopelessly Devoted to You” was an Oscar nominee for Best Original Song. The film’s soundtrack was 1978’s second-best seller.Olivia Newton-John net worth of $60 million.</p><p>Olivia Newton-John’s Grease creation? Newton-John was likely paid considerably for Grease due to her successful music career. Newton-John told Vanity Fair in 2016 that she almost didn’t portray Sandy since she didn’t know Grease would change her career. “I was very anxious about making another film, because my music career was going well,” Newton-John said. “And I didn’t want to ruin it with another bad film.” Vanity Fair reported that director Randal Kleiser doubted Newton-John could play Sandy due to her good-girl reputation from 1975’s Have You Never Been Mellow. “When I met her at that party, I thought, Well. Were You Never Calm? How will that work? What will make her slutty? Kleiser told Vanity Fair.</p><p>Travolta urged Kleiser to cast Newton-John as Danny’s ideal Sandy. “She had a brilliant voice, and I didn’t think there could be any more correct person for Sandy in the universe,” Travolta told Vanity Fair. Never gave up. I suggested meeting and casting her.” Travolta said Newton-John in Grease was like “putting Taylor Swift in that role today.” Newton-John wasn’t sure she could play Sandy. She felt too old to portray a teen compared to Travolta, 23, at 29. She worried about her American accent. After viewing with Travolta, she realised they had something special and relaxed. “Great chemistry,” she said.</p><p>Newton-John told Forbes in 2018 why she hesitated to play Grease. “Only I was nervous about making the movie. She said her musical career was prospering and she had made Toomorrow a few years earlier. It was fully equipped, produced by Don Kirshner, who made The Monkees, and Harry Saltzman, who co-produced James Bond movies. We were going to make musical movies together.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fox59.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/08/GettyImages-1229876701.jpg alt="Photos: Olivia Newton-John through the years | Fox 59" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She continued, “It was a total flop and expensive. I was concerned about making another musical film. I refused a screen exam if they made me American, so they made me Australian and had me take it. It’s funny now. I nearly skipped one of my favourite experiences.”</p><p>Newton-John told Forbes she’s amazed by Grease’s appeal. She said that some grandparents showed their kids and their kids’ kids the movie when it came out. I hear five-year-olds love the film. Interestingly, a new generation takes control every 8–10 years.” I don’t know if these youngsters saw it on TV or their parents have it. All the stories I hear about seeing it and its meaning might fill a book. I never tyre of that. I appreciate that fantastic experience.”Olivia Newton-John net worth of $60 million.</p><p>I never dreamed Grease would be a cultural classic, she told the outlet. “We believed in what we were doing but I don’t think anyone could have imagined that would be so popular 40 years later,” she said. We hoped the movie would do well, and it did, but I don’t think Paramount was excited about it. It sustained itself. It was fun to make, yet audiences can reject films you love. Its longevity is remarkable, but it shows no signs of ending. Saying ‘Sandy and Danny’ is simple.”</p><p>She remembered her first Travolta meeting. I remember certain things, but it was long ago. She said it’s unforgettable. The movie stays fresh because I talk about and remind myself of it. I never went to a special school, so it was normal. School was uniform, boys and girls were separated, and the environment was different. Many parts were new to me. We partied with film producer Allan Carr, who pushed us to stay. He gave us daily pep talks and motivated us.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fox59.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/08/GettyImages-1229876701.jpg><p>Olivia Newton-John recruited Bruce Welch, a music producer who co-wrote “Please Mr. Please.” in 1968. Our love ended tragically when Welch tried suicide after their 1972 engagement. Olivia dated businessman Lee Kramer in 1973 after this rough period. Though together throughout most of the 1970s, Newton-John called their relationship “one long breakup.”</p><p>Her romance changed when she married “Xanadu” co-star Matt Lattanzi on December 15, 1984. Chloe Rose, their daughter, was born in January 1986. Their marriage was difficult, and they divorced in 1995.</p><p>Olivia then dabbled with cameraman/gaffer Patrick McDermott for nearly a decade. However, McDermott’s 2005 disappearance while fishing off California’s coast raised suspicions that he had faked his death and was residing in Mexico.</p><p>Olivia’s love life improved when she married John Easterling on June 21, 2008.

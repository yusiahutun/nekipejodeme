The&nbsp;Suddenly Susan&nbsp;actress said Neeson "hungered after any female attention," and after he proposed to her (without a ring), he&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ghosted</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following a Christmas in which they were "buzzed all day long," Neeson left for Los Angeles after his basement had&nbsp;allegedly&nbsp;flooded.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I told him to phone me when he arrived," Shields wrote, to which Neeson said, "Oh, it'll be late, darlin."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After he left, Shields claimed she "never heard from him again.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shields&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told&nbsp;The Times</a>&nbsp;in 2014, "He was there one minute and gone the next.

After the release of her memoir, Shields&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told&nbsp;People</a>&nbsp;in 2014 that Neeson proposed a second time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He came back after the first time he left me and asked me to marry him again," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, "This was before he started to do a play [Anna Christie]. And I said, 'No, no, no, because knowing you, you'll probably fall in love with your next leading lady and marry her, so I'm leaving myself out of this.' And I was dead right."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Anna Christie's Broadway revival opened in early 1993, and Neeson wed his co-star, the late Natasha Richardson, the following year. They remained together until her death in 2009.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, Shields insisted there was no bad blood between her and the&nbsp;Schindler's List&nbsp;star.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Shields played Sally Bowles in&nbsp;Cabaret&nbsp;in 2001 (a role Richardson portrayed in the 1998 revival), she said the British actress visited her backstage. Shields ran into Neeson years later and asked him to thank his wife for her support.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Just tell her I was really honored she came backstage," she told him, per&nbsp;People. "She's the original, and she's amazing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Neeson reportedly owned up to his treatment of Shields as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>According to AOL</a>, Neeson corroborated Shields's account on&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen&nbsp;in 2015 â€” well, sort of.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm not going to deny it. I actually don't really remember. It was many years ago, but â€¦ I flew off to L.A., and I didn't call her back. It sounds ... yeah, I guess it was," Neeson said.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though he admitted they haven't kept in touch, Neeson called Shields "a great lady and a fantastic girl."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple reached their true pinnacle decades after their split when Shields&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>appeared on&nbsp;WWHL</a>&nbsp;in 2014. During the "Plead the Fifth" segment, host Cohen asked Shields if she could confirm the rumors that Neeson is "famously well-endowed."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress replied, "True," to which Cohen asked, "It's massive?"

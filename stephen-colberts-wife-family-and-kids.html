It is always a pleasure to see him on the television screen but now we have an opportunity to look beyond the surface and meet members of his family in person. We hope you are as excited about this prospect as we are!</p><p>Read on to learn more about Stephen Colbert’s Wife, Family And Kids</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Stephen Colbert Wife</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/stephen-colbert-Wife-evelyn-mcgee-colbert-640x360.jpg><p>Stephen Colbert and Evelyn McGee-Colbert’s 23 years of marriage are undoubtedly solid evidence that they have one of the most durable marriages ever to come to public attention. To top it all off there is a love story. As silly as it may seem at times Evelyn affectionately nicknamed Evie by her husband was not her first and only lover. The comedian had a long-term relationship with a woman named Ann.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger’s House, Family, And Divorce</a></strong></p><p>Like some women today who issue ultimatums to each other to advance a relationship Ann threatened to break up with the host of the television show if they did not take their relationship to the next level of marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stephen-Colbert’s-Wife.jpg><p>Stephen Colbert returned to his hometown of South Carolina to visit his mother and receive guidance. Shortly after their conversation, he decided it was time to end things with Ann. Later that day at a concert, Stephen’s gaze fell upon a beautiful woman – Evie – who unbeknownst to him had grown up in the same town as him. As fate would have it, with the help of an old friend and some divine intervention from The Odyssey, these two were destined for each other from the start.</p><p>Both have been married since 1993 and are still in good health. She is an actress and even played Stephen’s mother in the film’Strangers With Candy’. She has now taken the title of “stay-at-home mother” which does not prevent her from breaking the law as her husband is not allowed to bring her work home. There are no sarcastic and mean characters allowed in the Colbert residence. She is also known for her cameo in ‘The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug’ (2013).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Stephen&nbsp;</strong><strong>and she met in a Theater Lobby</strong></h2><p>At a showing of the musical Hydrogen Jukebox Stephen had an unexpected encounter with Evelyn in the theater lobby. At that moment he knew she was special and made a silent vow to himself – this is who I’m going to marry. The Late Show host later revealed that his intuition was right; he and Evelyn are now happily married.</p><p>At the afterparty of the show, Stephen and Evelyn crossed paths in a food line. He remembered thinking to himself that if he did not turn around and greet her he would regret it for the rest of his life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>She has worked as an actress</strong></h2><p>Evelyn has had a successful career in the entertainment industry with her husband Stephen by her side. She has earned several acting credits over the years including appearances on Strangers With Candy – of which Stephen was a co-producer – and Alpha House.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>She works at the production company Stephen started</strong></h2><p>Evelyn is an accomplished professional currently serving as Vice President of Spartina Productions – a production company founded by Stephen. Additionally, she works independently as a film producer for the same organization and holds the position of President on the Montclair Film Board of Trustees.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Stephen Colbert Wife&nbsp;is very active in their community in New Jersey</strong></h2><p>The husband and wife duo of Stephen and Evelyn have been pivotal members of the Montclair New Jersey community for many years. Evelyn has had a longstanding involvement with the Montclair Film Festival since its inception with Bob Feinberg – founder of the festival – noting that she was his “first call” when he first came up with the idea. Since then both Stephen and Evelyn have worked hard to bring attention to this annual event through fundraising efforts as well as publicity campaigns.</p><p>The couple demonstrated their commitment to the community by generously contributing to the New Jersey Arts and Culture Recovery Fund which provided much-needed assistance to local arts and cultural organizations that were adversely affected by the economic impact of COVID-19.</p><p>Evelyn emphasized the significance of creative outlets for individuals families and communities alike. She further urged that we should not take this sector’s sustainability for granted and that each contribution is vital in ensuring its survival.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Stephen Colbert’s Family</strong></h2><p>The 52-year-old actor is the youngest of 11 children. Colbert and his brothers and sisters in order from the eldest to the youngest are James Edward Mary William Margo Thomas Thomas Jay Elizabeth Paul Peter and Stephen of course. His father James William Colbert Jr. was quite accomplished in his field being a doctor and dean of the medical school at more than two universities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stepen-Colbert-Wife-Evelyn-McGee-Colbert.jpg><p>He served at Yale University, Saint Louis University, and finally at the Southern California University of Medicine where he also served as Vice President for Academic Affairs. Colbert’s mother, Lorna Elizabeth Colbert, did what any woman with 11 children would do and maintained the role of a home builder.</p><p>Tragedy struck Colbert House when Stephen was only 10 years old on September 11, 1974. His father and two brothers, Peter and Paul, were killed in the crash of Eastern Airlines Flight 212 attempting to land in Charlotte, North Carolina. It is no mystery now why his sons are called Peter and Paul. Colbert’s mother died 39 years later, on June 12, 2013, at the age of 92, after a period of illness.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Stephen Colbert’s Kids</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stephen-Colbert-Family.jpg><p>The host of the television show has three children with his wife Evelyn their first child and only daughter is Madeline 20 then Peter 17 and finally John 14. There is no doubt that some of us envy these children for growing up in a comedy house so to speak. Colbert mentioned in one of the episodes of The Daily Show that he and his wife rely equally on laughter in their parenting role.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stephen-Colbert’s-Kids.jpg><p>When they were younger Stephen did not let his children watch “The Colbert Report” about which he also explained that “children cannot understand irony or sarcasm and I don’t want them to perceive me as a hypocrite”. We’re sure they’ve gone beyond that and moved on to more fun things for example the actor with his sons and wife made a great appearance in ‘The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug’.</p><p>Now we would like to be part of the Colbert family.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Mark Wahlberg Siblings, Family, And Kids</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Quick Facts About Stephen Colbert</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=3.5><tr><th><span>&nbsp;Date of Birth:</span></th><td><span class="value birthday">13 May 1964</span></td></tr><tr><th><span>&nbsp;Age:</span></th><td>59 years old</td></tr><tr><th><span>&nbsp;Birth Nation:</span></th><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><th><span>&nbsp;Height:</span></th><td>5 Feet 11 Inch</td></tr><tr><th><span>Name</span></th><td>Stephen Colbert</td></tr><tr><th><span>Birth Name</span></th><td>Stephen Colbert</td></tr><tr readability=3><th><span>Father</span></th><td>James William Colbert, Jr.</td></tr><tr><th><span>Mother</span></th><td>Lorna Colbert</td></tr><tr><th><span>Nationality</span></th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th><span>Birth Place/City</span></th><td>Washington, D.C</td></tr><tr><th><span>Ethnicity</span></th><td>White</td></tr><tr><th><span>Profession</span></th><td>Comedian</td></tr><tr><th><span>Working For</span></th><td>Movies, TV Shows</td></tr><tr><th><span>Net Worth</span></th><td>$ 45 million</td></tr><tr><th><span>Salary</span></th><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><th><span>Eye Color</span></th><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><th><span>Hair Color</span></th><td>Black</td></tr><tr><th><span>Married</span></th><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><th><span>Married to</span></th><td>Evelyn McGee-Colbert (m. 1993)</td></tr><tr><th><span>Children</span></th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th><span>Divorce</span></th><td>Not Yet</td></tr><tr><th><span>Education</span></th><td>Northwestern University</td></tr><tr><th><span>Movies</span></th><td>Rick and Morty</td></tr><tr readability=2><th><span>TV Show</span></th><td>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</td></tr><tr><th><span>Sisters</span></th><td>Elizabeth Colbert Busch</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kwLWxz6Gcp2WTpLmjsdGtqmavmZuybrLApqClsV2Wu6V5yqKbrGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./when-karisma-kapoor-saved-her-prem-qaidi-co-actor-harish-kumar-from-drowning-deets-1301169.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="When Karisma Kapoor saved her Prem Qaidi co-actor Harish Kumar from drowning">&larr;

The TV star and relationships coach sat on the ITV sofa opposite Dermot O'Leary and Josie Gibson to speak about her symptoms, her diagnosis and her recent operation.</p><p id=eGtsvHep5Ci data-wc=31>Before being diagnosed with colon cancer in December 2023 and undergoing immediate surgery, Mel revealed she was in pain and suffering typical symptoms, but was putting off doing anything about it.</p><p id=efNxlEd6xL data-wc=32>&nbsp;"I ignored the signs for such a long time," she began, adding: "My energy levels had dropped and I was having such incredible gut pain, literally doubled over in pain and shouting."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5344ca14dbb5-mel-on-this-morning.jpg><p id=eGkjGDz4fB data-wc=37>The star continued: "And I stopped going to the toilet completely, but I was doing so much international travel. <strong>I wasn't sleeping and my whole digestive system stopped but I put it down to the travel."</strong></p><p id=ehnJDYYN_oV data-wc=44>Mel then opened up about how she came to be diagnosed. "I did see a GP in Australia and they said it's constipation, you'll be fine. I then flew back to the UK and it became more serious, I couldn't even hold down water.&nbsp;</p><p id=ebCKuHuZZY data-wc=24>So I went to a gastroenterologist and he could pinpoint the signs, and for him, it was the unexplained weight loss, which was alarming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/569048ce479d-mel-schilling.jpg><p id=effvr5KgTl data-wc=42>"He got me in for a CT scan within 24 hours and they found Terry [the tumour], right there in my colon blocking everything. They looked at the results, brought Gareth, my husband, and I in and they said, 'You have cancer'."</p><p id=eh9MJfeVm3S data-wc=30>Despite the extremely worrying diagnosis, Mel insists she was lucky: "That's why I say this a good news story. It's absolutely been tough, but it was a reasonably early intervention.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">What are the symptoms of bowel cancer?</h3><h1>What is bowel cancer?</h1><p id=eqSqqmyoQj>Bowel cancer is a general term for cancer that begins in the large bowel. Depending on where the cancer starts, bowel cancer is sometimes called colon or rectal cancer.</p><p id=ef2Xys3pptr>According to the NHS, the below are the key symptoms to look out for.</p><p id=eM1v8K-_bA><strong>The three main symptoms of bowel cancer are:</strong></p><ul><li>Persistent blood in the stools – that happens for no obvious reason or is associated with a change in bowel habit</li><li>A persistent change in your bowel habit – which is usually having to poo more and your poo may also become more runny</li><li>Persistent lower abdominal (tummy) pain, bloating or discomfort – that's always caused by eating and may be associated with loss of appetite or significant unintentional weight loss</li></ul><p id=eypDXWJlmLB>Most people with these symptoms do not have bowel cancer. See your GP if you have one or more of the symptoms of bowel cancer and they have persisted for more than three weeks.<br></p><p id=eOx-DeZrNg data-wc=26>"Though it was stage three, so still very serious, if I had waited another month or so longer it could have been a very different story."</p><span class=socialEmbedCaptionClass_s1blps23>Mel underwent surgery in December</span><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=ebYcAAIUg2O data-wc=43>After appearing on the ITV programme, Mel took to her Instagram, stating: "Well … that was a very different @thismorning segment today. Rather than offering advice to others, I had the opportunity to talk about my own experience - my bowel cancer journey."</p><p id=eNjc6TjfzQ data-wc=42>She then listed the key messages from the chat including listening to your body, asking for help if something feels wrong, and if your bowel habits have changed to ask for GP for a stool test, also known as a FIT test.</p><p id=esvz-hMd8j data-wc=16><strong data-gid=e-whQMOIaw>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Michael Strahan's daughter Isabella, 19, cries as she reaches emotional milestone amid brain cancer battle</a><strong data-gid=e_hg0GGmxbY>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ei8wL89QB-I data-wc=15><strong data-gid=eTnSYWT4av>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>LeAnn Rimes shares heartbreaking health update as she undergoes surgery: 'I've had enough trauma'</a></strong></p><p id=e6ZSHQ45UcS data-wc=38>Fans were quick to heap messages of praise and support on the television star: "This is so epic! Well done for sharing! You could well have saved so many lives among those watching by raising awareness! Thank you!"</p><p id=eFb-MsN-u- data-wc=33>&nbsp;Another said: "Amazing, informative and inspirational as always, Mel. So lovely to see you looking so well." A third added: "Thankyou for raising awareness for Colon Cancer… You Are An Inspiration To All."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b9f677245057-mel-schilling-with-partner-and-daughter.jpg><p id=eYIxXUeM9fw data-wc=33>After undergoing surgery in December, Mel has since shared an update on how she's doing now. Earlier this week, she wrote on Instagram: "Cancer Update: My PET scan was all clear. No spread."</p><p id=eLuz2z1Fq2P data-wc=57>She added: "Terry Tumour was definitely cancer. Doc removed 38 lymph nodes and six of them were malignant. <strong>The cancer had spread to some of the fat cells around my colon, all removed now. Next steps: chemo for three months. It will be a combination of infusions in the hospital & tablets at home.

Is she able to walk or sleep with a man? Could she function like a normal human being? What of relieving herself? These among many other questions puzzled everyone who saw the photo of Josephine Myrtle Corbin. The sceptics could not believe in the existence of such a woman. But were the images real or Photoshopped?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e886f8dce9b91559.png><p class=align-left>Born on 12th May, 1868, Josephine Myrtle Corbin had a rare body condition called dipygus. She was an ordinary girl as doctors who examined her confirmed. Her father, William Corbin, was 25 years old when his daughter was born and her mother, Nancy Corbin, was 34 years old.</p><p class=align-left>Physicians found that the parents were more identical with blue eyes, red hair and fair complexion, more like blood kin. However, their blood revealed that they were not biologically related. The couple begot four sons and four daughters who were physically normal.</p><p class=align-left>With her condition, Josephine could have been considered a bad omen in Africa tradition and probably been thrown in a forest for wild animals to feast on. However, her family treated her as they did her blood siblings who were normal. Is it a fact that this woman was a dipygus? Still wondering about the dilemma that faced the four-legged lady? Here is the truth behind the mystery.</p><h2>What is a dipygus?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d0699517869baa04.png><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dipygus deformity</a> is an extreme and severe form of caudal replication where the body axis at the pelvic end duplicates. Various factors including teratogenic, environmental and genetic are thought to be responsible for this condition.</p><p class=align-left>It starts early while the baby is in the womb and affects notochord derivatives and embryonic cloaca. This leads to degenerate splitting of the germinal disc at the pelvic end. Myrtle Corbin’s is one of the few such cases that have been reported in the medical history.</p><h2>Josephine Myrtle anatomy</h2><p class=align-left>Though she lived a normal life, Josephine Myrtle anatomy beyond the four legs was weird. Although her limbs were capable of movement, her inner legs were straightforward and were found at birth resting flat on her belly. The two legs were like those of a parasitic twin except there was no twin, but Myrtle’s pelvis along the middle axis had spit. Pictures of Myrtle Corbin walking reveals that her inner legs were shorter than the external ones.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Coronavirus news and latest updates (first death outside China)</p><p class=align-left>More interestingly, the four-legged woman had a complete, unique set of genital organs between each pair of legs both internal and external. The organs were both supported by a pubic arch making it look like two co-joined women. Each set functioned autonomously except during the menstrual period. While Myrtle had two bowel sets and two anuses, the sets were independent such that there could be constipation on one side and diarrhoea on the other.</p><p class=align-left>Later when she conceived, Josephine experienced normal symptoms of a pregnant woman except that she felt severe pain in her left side. When the doctor told her that she was expectant in her left uterus, she reacted in astonishment saying that she would believe if the pregnancy was on the right side. The doctor examined her further and found that her right genitals were most reliable for sexual intercourse.</p><h2>Was Josephine Myrtle Corbin married?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6f24af7743464ed4.png><p class=align-left>Having known her anatomy, can anyone accept to marry a four-legged human? How did Myrtle Corbin give birth? To the astonishment of many people of her generation, Josephine Myrtle Corbin was married when she was 19 years old to a doctor called James Clinton Bicknell. Though she got pregnant one year later, the pregnancy ended in abortion due to some complications that she experienced in the spring of 1887.</p><p class=align-left>Fortunately, Myrtle Corbin children born later in her life were healthy and normal. The couple was able to raise up four kids, three girls and one boy, even though the first pregnancy was unsuccessful. Mrs. Bicknell was physically responsible as a mother and wife with the ability to accomplish all her household chores and care for her children.</p><h2>Josephine Myrtle career</h2><p class=align-left>Josephine Corbin joined sideshow circuit when she was 13 years old bearing the name “Four-Legged Girl from Texas.” One of her early promotional pamphlets labelled her as being happy all day long and gentle as the summer sunshine disposition. She became popular in this industry where other showmen falsified their performances by exhibiting four-legged gaffs. When Myrtle stopped performing, other pretentious four-legged women emerged and continued attracting large audiences.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>11 deadly diseases your skin is trying to caution you against</p><h2>How old was Myrtle Corbin when she died?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/76ed37fd48457528.jpg><p class=align-left>This is a question that everyone reading Corbin’s story wishes to know. Myrtle Corbin died on 6th May 1928 in Cleburne, Texas when she was 59 years old.</p><h2>How did Myrtle Corbin die?</h2><p class=align-left>There are various factors that lead to the death of a human being including diseases. Josephine Myrtle was not spared by one of these ailments after living a normal life for over half a century. A streptococcal skin infection led to the death of Josephine Myrtle Corbin. Modern antibiotics could have treated the condition but such treatments were not available during the time.</p><p class=align-left>Myrtle Corbin’s casket was buried underground and covered with concrete to prevent grave robbers who could have stolen her corpse. This action might have been motivated by various offers from physicians who wanted to pay her family in exchange for the corpse. The family declined the offer and some of the members kept vigil on her grave until the concrete was completely dry.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong></p><ul><li>Coronavirus: Kenyan student tests negative for deadly disease</li><li>Medicine courses, requirements, and colleges and universities offering them in Kenya</li></ul><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2Fk2xoam9dn7y0sc%2BhoKedXaLGs8DLnmScp6KXtq95k2ajnp%2BXmrFuw86mmKdlo6m8s8WMn5icrKNivam706iqZ6Ckork%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jimmy-graham.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jimmy Graham dating?

But <a class=hm-link href=#>Suki Waterhouse</a> is different. For a start, she is more beautiful in the flesh; as if the camera cannot quite capture her spirit, her flawless skin and her wide-eyed, Cupid's bow doll-like features. So it comes as no surprise at all to find out that modelling is not her first love – acting is. But with a huge contract just signed up for Redken, her deal with Burberry still firmly in place and the lead role in an upcoming thriller romance film starring <strong>Jim Carrey </strong>and <strong>Keanu Reeves</strong>, she is on course to become one of those rare women – a model who is also a successful actress.</p><p style=text-align:center id=eCzhfkguDvlY><span><strong></strong></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1adcdcf8c8c9-suki1-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eo7jJGr58sas data-wc=6><strong>Suki Waterhouse revealed her beauty secrets</strong></p><p id=ebHqPCJI0IP4 data-wc=19><strong>Being named as Redken's new ambassador must have been really exciting. How have you found working with the brand?</strong></p><p id=eka8zE_6q4Xz data-wc=116>"I really shouldn't admit this, but I was actually terrible with hair products. I'd never really used proper hair products before, so to be honest it has been a real education – I've discovered that hair products can actually make your hair better [laughs]. Now I put on Diamond Oil before I have a blow-dry, to moisturise my hair and protect it, and Pillow Proof, which is this perfect mix of hairspray and dry shampoo. It's my favourite because I never want to shampoo my hair – I just want it bigger and bigger and more and more tousled. So if I can get away with using that, I will, as it stops it getting greasy."</p><p id=eQR21KewflYd data-wc=10><strong>You sound pretty low-maintenance when it comes to your hair…</strong></p><p id=eb77C1xjAHQZ data-wc=83>"Yes I am. I even cut my own hair at times; I have been known to disappear into the bathroom and cut my own fringe – not something I would recommend. But the only way to keep my hair looking good is to use a mask, because in this business your hair gets beyond battered by all the styling and heat and colour changes. In future, I intend to go to George Northwood for a cut and his sister Sally for my colour."</p><p id=eGJI2TLUJRMc data-wc=5><strong>Have you always been blonde?</strong></p><p id=e3g7kxpIxk2b data-wc=39>"I come from a family of blondes. I have a younger brother and two younger sisters and we are all blonde. I went brunette once for a film and really liked it – it matched my eyebrows for once."</p><p id=eoK_KGCvbLKi data-wc=20><strong>Talking of your brows, they are something of a signature for you. Have you ever been tempted to pluck them?</strong></p><p id=eEOjW1jR9lRn data-wc=42>"No, but look closely and you will see that they are four different colours because they keep getting dyed. They are like tiger brows right now. I don't put any colour in them, I just keep them groomed with Anastasia brow gel."</p><p id=enk9Tq4umgl5 data-wc=10><strong>I'm mesmerised by your incredibly long lashes. Are they real?</strong></p><p id=etqqIixUQidf data-wc=34>"Yes, they are. To be honest, I think it's the amazing Serge Lutens mascara in brown, then the clear on top. I can't take any credit – my make-up artist introduced me to them."</p><p id=ewcnz6Qqv52I data-wc=6><strong>Do you have a signature scent?</strong></p><p id=epkII2JtZnMW data-wc=32>"Burberry Brit Rhythm. I spent three days filming the campaign for Burberry and everything I had with me ended up smelling of the scent and now it's become a part of me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/47034ee8f856-suki2-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=epFANBQ0WMce data-wc=12><strong>Suki revealed she is low maintenance when it comes to her hair</strong></p><p id=evpeCN2kdqX5 data-wc=28><strong>I shared a cab with your father, world-famous reconstructive surgeon Norman Waterhouse, the other day and he pointed out your pictures in the window of Burberry in Knightsbridge…</strong></p><p id=e0vHHJ8aC81U data-wc=67>"Really? That is so sweet. He'd never do that in front of me. I am so proud of him. He is more than a triple threat: his work as a surgeon is incredible; his charity Facing the World offers reconstructive work here in the UK for children born with facial disfigurement around the globe: and I've just attended an amateur charity boxing match where he boxed. Seriously."</p><p id=e85nPQq3I8dR data-wc=6><strong>What is your top skincare tip?</strong></p><p id=epZnWJD3PXvO data-wc=54>"I often do a raw honey mask. I just apply it to freshly cleansed skin for a few minutes then rinse off – it leave my face so soft. And if my skin is irritated and red, especially around the nose and mouth, then I rely on HealGel; my father helped to create it."</p><p id=exKIg-kmwO5d data-wc=10><strong>And the best beauty advice you have ever been given?</strong></p><p id=eiTJQ-O1sJAW data-wc=20>"Georgia [Jagger]'s mum [Jerry Hall] says you have to force yourself to drink more water. It's boring but it works."</p><p id=eX_c0NlYF5uo data-wc=8><strong>Where do you go for a great facial?</strong></p><p id=edibVeDZww1E data-wc=53>"In LA I see a facialist called Shani Darden, who looks after <a class=hm-link href=#>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Jessica Alba</a> – she has got me into iS Clinical and her own retinol once a week. In London I go to my dad's clinic, Waterhouse Young, and have the hyaluronic or oxygen facial. I've come to know what works for me."</p><p id=eU9jMo-Pd3Eu data-wc=5><strong>What's your biggest beauty bugbear?</strong></p><p id=eMEzCrcQL-zu data-wc=12>"Too much make-up. I hate it when faces are covered in it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ece24469ae78-products-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eIYFq3Lklm-m data-wc=12><strong>The model shared her beauty must-haves: scroll below for the full list</strong></p><p id=eN-c4xyyxheW data-wc=6><strong>How do you stay in shape?</strong></p><p id=eqYMK9nUvi4U data-wc=83>"I used to be really into personal training but I've realised that I don't have to do so much as I am constantly running around. Nowadays, I'm more interested in workouts that make me less stressed because then I can clear my head. So I like yoga and running. I don't have to run far, just for half an hour, and I come back with so many ideas. The only problem is I have to stop and write to-do lists on my phone."</p><p id=e2vjFKuNZhTk data-wc=10><strong>Do you believe that great models are born or made?</strong></p><p id=eXyD-_368PKI data-wc=76>"I think the true greats are born with what it takes. But add to that good luck and timing. Today there are so many different types of model – supermodels, famous models on Instagram, catwalk models. My model icon growing up was <strong>Kate Moss</strong>. She goes beyond being a model – she is more rock star. I mean, she is not allowed into America – that is so rock star. She is the epitome of cool."</p><p id=eEX-5DEyCNrh data-wc=10><strong>You travel a lot – where, for you, is home?</strong></p><p id=e8t7HPwSHTYn data-wc=49>"I hadn't been in London for seven months, then I came back and moved back into my parents' place and instantly realised I needed to find somewhere of my own. So I have just bought my first flat. I love it, but my brother and sisters have keys too."</p><p id=epAelrNCsyPg data-wc=6><strong>How do you rest and relax?</strong></p><p id=eUghixfr4rpw data-wc=55>"This summer I went to the Mayr Clinic in Austria for five days with my mother to detox. It was super-relaxing and restful. I went straight after Glastonbury, so I ended up sleeping for most of the time. I am still on their base powder alkalising drink. I drink it whenever I'm busy or travelling."</p><p id=e3R3zq4k_KSC data-wc=17><strong>is your most high-profile film so far. What can you tell me about it?</strong></p><p id=eWhGauR8zuYY data-wc=42>"Well, I play the lead and the other characters are my lovers. It's a thriller, horror, romance set in Texas, but we filmed it in LA. All I can say is that it's a dystopian love story and that cannibals are involved."</p><p id=eYzNaahVdguS data-wc=6><strong>Who are your acting role models?</strong></p><p id=eYaijrH94Vdr data-wc=5>"Alicia Vikander and Marion Cotillard."</p><p id=ejjLJK2MJTSF data-wc=8><strong>What was the last film you loved watching?</strong></p><p id=eTpxxdES39lB data-wc=11>" – it's one of the best films ever made."</p><p id=e2scZse2Jv08 data-wc=7><strong>And the last song you danced to?</strong></p><p id=e9idEVdQckEc data-wc=13>"Right now it always seems to be by Taylor Swift."</p><p id=eUHo7JwrMpOb data-wc=4><strong>Any plans for Christmas?</strong></p><p id=eStguOfnGYwG data-wc=18>"To be at home with my family, then off to Barbados straight after, with my family as well."</p><p id=eFfMItNscR54 data-wc=7><strong>Warehouse winners: Suki shares her favourite buys</strong></p><p id=eUD7SvZrNwJC data-wc=100><strong>1.

Ashley and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=http://toofab.com/people/wynonna-judd><strong>Wynonna</strong></a> broke the news via Instagram, sharing, "Today we sisters experienced a tragedy. We lost our beautiful mother to the disease of mental illness."</p><p>"We are shattered. We are navigating profound grief and know that as we loved her, she was loved by her public. We are in unknown territory."</p><p>While appearing on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>All There Is with Anderson Cooper</strong></a> podcast in November, Ashley and Anderson Cooper<a href=#><strong> opened up </strong></a>about navigating the tragic loss of loved ones who died by suicide. (Cooper's brother, Carter, died in 1998.)</p><p>"My mother's death was traumatic and unexpected, because it was death by suicide, and I found her," Ashley shared. "My grief was in lockstep with trauma because of the manner of her death, and the fact that I found her. I held my mother as she was dying, and there was blood, and I just needed to process the fact that I was with my mother's blood."</p><p>"I'm so glad I was there because even when I walked in that room, and I saw that she had harmed herself, the first thing out of my mouth was, 'Mama, I see how much you've been suffering,'" she continued. "'And it is okay to go. It is okay to go. I am here. It is okay to let go. I love you.'"</p><p>Ashley added that she got in bed with her mother, and held her. "[I] said, 'Let it all go. Be free. ... All was forgiven long ago. Leave it all here. Take nothing with you. Just be free,'"</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with depression or has had thoughts of harming themselves or taking their own life, get help. <strong>The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (just dial 988)</strong> provides 24/7, free, confidential support for people in distress.</p><a id=gallery-link-ed89797e-6675-4a48-b414-9bceb74356cc class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:ed89797e-6675-4a48-b414-9bceb74356cc data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:7e4ad7a9-9b34-4aea-b93e-28c586b391b0 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8c/4by3/2024/04/22/8c14ec1b1bb940d6aefb79d39e6f4306_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21ma2xflsCpuMSyZKOtlJl6rrvMZqWap52eeq6xza2YpWWZobmvsdKsZJuZpKm5pnnWoaCtnV2dvLa%2FxGaqqZ2VmLVw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lauren-alaina-lainey-wilson-tractor-supply-emerging-artist-mentor.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lainey Wilson, Lauren Alaina + More Pay It Forward as Mentors">&larr;

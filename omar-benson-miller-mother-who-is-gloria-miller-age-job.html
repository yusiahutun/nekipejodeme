In fact, he might be even sweeter for he is still his momma’s little boy.</span></p><p><span>But who is his mother, Gloria Miller? Learn all about her as you scroll down.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Gloria Miller, Omar Benson Miller Mother</b></h3><p><span>Gloria Miller is Omar Benson Miller’s mother who often graces the star’s socials. From birthday celebrations to watching the World Series games, the pair were often pictured together.</span></p><p><span>According to the actor, his mother is full of “life, wisdom, and love.” He is proud to have her in his life and wishes her over 100 more years to live.</span></p><p><span>With love, Omar calls his mother “Ace.”</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, he calls his father Alec Miller “Smiley.” But it wasn’t only him, everyone called Alec by that nickname. In a selfie shared on Instagram in August 2021, the actor wrote, “They call him Smiley for a reason … Got some sun and iced tea with my Pop, and we laughed … a lot.”</span></p><p><span>Overall, Omar shares a healthy relationship with his parents.</span></p><p><span>As for those of you wondering, Gloria isn’t related to Forest Whitaker. Since her son looked a lot like Forest, there was a rumor floating around the two could be relatives. But in a 2008 interview with ESPN, Omar ended the misconception that he and the Academy Award-winning actor are related.</span></p><p><span>Before that, even Wikipedia listed the two actors as relatives, which Omar blatantly denied. “That’s not true. Wikipedia is full of crap,” he said.</span></p><h3><b>Gloria Miller Husband And Kids</b></h3><p><span>Gloria Miller is married to her husband Alec Miller with seven kids.</span></p><p><span>Her husband, Alec was born on August 20, 1938, to sharecroppers in Mississippi. “He’s lived in poverty, luxury, wealth, racism, harmony, the Watts & LA riots, attended the funeral of #EmmittTill, survived Jim Crow, created an enterprise from nothing and created a family raising seven kids of his own, and a gang of others along his journey and through it all he’s never stopped laughing. He is the #AmericanDream” Omar said.</span></p><p><span>As for her kids, Gloria has sons named David A Miller (born: Oct 1969), Andrew Miller, Terry Miller (lived in Los Angeles, California), Eric Miller, and Omar Benson Miller.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, Eric passed away on May 23, 2016, from a seizure. He was an entrepreneur, a father, and a leader. “Whether they were right or wrong he did it his way. Even in his last days. He never accepted death or his epilepsy. He knew he could have a seizure at any time but that never stopped him. Every day it was business as usual. I remember him sending me a copy of his advertisement for his growing computer business and asking me my thoughts,” a friend said,</span></p><h3><b>Gloria Miller Age</b></h3><p><span>Gloria Miller was 80 years of age in 2023.</span></p><p><span>This means she had Omar when she was 36.</span></p><h3><b>Where Is Gloria Miller From?</b></h3><p><span>Gloria Miller hails from California.</span></p><p><span>So far, she’s lived in Glendale, Compton, Bellflower, West Hollywood, Long Beach, and&nbsp; Anaheim.</span></p><h3><b>Gloria Miller Job</b></h3><p><span>Gloria Miller worked as an Administrative Assistant for </span><i><span>Be Productions</span></i><span>.

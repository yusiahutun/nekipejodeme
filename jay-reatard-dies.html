The 29-year-old was found at his home early on Tuesday morning, according to friends. Police have reportedly opened an investigation into his death, which comes less than six months after the release of his breakthrough LP, Watch Me Fall.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Lindsey was one of the most prolific and celebrated artists of today's lo-fi punk-rock scene. He broke into the Memphis underground at just 15, releasing a demo that caught the ear of Goner Records and then a string of singles and LPs with the Reatards, the Lost Sounds, Final Solutions and as a solo act. When Lindsey's label, indie powerhouse Matador, joked in his <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">biography</a> that he released "90-something" records, they are probably not far off. As co-owner of Shattered Records, Lindsey also brought many other acts into his noisy, catchy sphere.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Memphis newspaper the Commercial Appeal reports that Lindsey's room-mate discovered his body at about 3:30am on Tuesday. According to police spokeswoman Jennifer Robinson, Lindsey was in bed and had recently been complaining of flu-like symptoms. While police have opened an investigation into his death, this is a procedural decision and not based on evidence of foul play.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>"We are devastated by the death of [Jay]," said Matador spokesman Nils Bernstein. "[He] was as full of life as anyone we've ever met, and responsible for so many memorable moments as a person and artist. We're honoured to have known and worked with him, and we will miss him terribly."</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Goner Records also issued a statement: "It is with great sadness that we report the passing of our good friend Jay Reatard. Jay died in his sleep last night. We will pass along information about funeral arrangements when they are made public."</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Lindsey's death follows the recent passing of another Memphis icon, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Willie Mitchell</a>. Members of the local community were at a memorial service for the soul producer when they heard the news of Lindsey's death, according to the Commercial Appeal. Beck, for whom Lindsey recorded a B-side, posted his version of Gamma Ray to his <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">website</a>.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>As a performer, Lindsey was notorious for his abrasive, often provocative performances. Last December, he was attacked by fans at a gig in Austin, Texas. In his <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">last message to Twitter</a>, posted on Monday afternoon, he offered $100 "per tyre" to anyone who vandalised band <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Liquor Store</a>'s tour van.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Speaking to Billboard last summer, Lindsey said his new album was about "dealing with mortality issues, growing older, disenchantment with your youth". The LP, which saw Lindsey shift from punk rock to noisy pop, was "the first record where I'm kind of exiting the dumb kid part of my life and going into the almost-30 point". Tragically, he will forever remain on that cusp.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaKWlqLake5FpaGlnmpa7cH2TaKGasV2nsqLAwKubZpyZmsA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kristen-bell-apology-woman-in-the-house-netflix.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kristen Bell apologises for shocking Woman in the House scene  details">&larr;

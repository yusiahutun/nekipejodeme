I’d come home from school and go straight to the computer, making beats and learning to record my own music. I’d sometimes say, “Damn, if this isn’t meant to be, I don’t know what I’ll do because I don’t have another dream,'” he told the publication.</p><p>It looks like the star’s career Plan B is ‘miles away’ from what his ‘ex’ Kendall Jenner’s probably would be, if the infamous cucumber video is anything to go by.</p><p>However, it seems like he could have taught her a few things, as one fan tweeted: “Wonder if Bad Bunny is teaching Kendall Jenner how to cut a cucumber.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kendall-jenner-and-bad-bunny-attend-super-bowl-separately-after-recent-reconciliation>Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny attend Super Bowl separately after recent ‘reconciliation’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1254370976-1024x723.jpg><p>Hearts broke around the globe at the end of last year, when it was revealed that Kendall and Bad Bunny had gone their separate ways.</p><p>However, last month, rumors of a reconciliation between the two were circulating. “Kendall’s friends aren’t surprised whatsoever that she’s seeing Bad Bunny again. They figured this would happen because she has a habit of going back to exes,”&nbsp;a source <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> US Weekly.</p><p>It was reported the <a href=#>couple</a> were not fully back together, but “they have hung out a few times since breaking up last month.”</p><p>The two both attended the <a href=#>Super Bowl</a> on Sunday night, although not together. In fact, Jenner’s ex Devin Booker was spotted in her suite, although there were no ‘romantic’ signs between the two.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2aBcK7AnWSbrZ6jxm7DwKxkoKeZo7RuwM5mrqiqm2K2r3nToZxmm6Whtq%2Bt0bJkmqqkqHqqsoyhoKxllKeyormMnaCdpqRisLC5xGarq62VZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lili-reinhart-bisexual-black-lives-matter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lili Reinhart Comes Out as Bisexual in Support of Black Lives Matter">&larr;

Let's find out how the Varla's entry-level eScooter performed under review conditions...</p><h5 class=display-card-title>Varla Wasp eScooter</h5>6.5<span>/ 10</span><p class=display-card-description>The Varla Wasp eScooter is designed with commuters in mind. It is for short journeys around the city, so the relatively low range and minimal top speed should not be an issue if you are riding your scooter to work. However, the awkward placement of the speed toggle button makes this hard to recommend to anyone other than an absolute beginner who wants to build their scooter confidence, or a commuter who slows down prior to shifting speeds.</p><strong>Brand</strong> <span>Varla</span> <strong>Weight</strong> <span>33 lbs</span> <strong>Range</strong> <span>19 miles</span> <strong>Battery</strong> <span>36V 7.5Ah</span> <strong>Max.

Once you break the box open, you'll find:</p><ul><li>Varla Wasp eScooter</li><li>Charger</li><li>Assembly tool</li><li>Screws</li><li>User Manual</li></ul><p>That is everything the box contains. So what next? You can't ride straight away, you need to assemble the Wasp first...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=assembling-the-wasp>Assembling the Wasp</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/varla-wasp-electric-scooter-assembly.jpg><p>To be truthful, there is very little involved with assembly of the Wasp, but you still need to do one thing. This is attaching the handlebar, and it is very easy to do. You need to grab the four screws and the assembly tool, and fix the handlebar in position.</p><p>Once you have done this, you can charge the Wasp up ready for your first ride. As I said, a very simple assembly process. Note that I also needed to tighten the thumb throttle a touch as it was loose when I pressed it, so check that for surety as well.</p><h2 id=varla-wasp-a-compact-cruiser>Varla Wasp: A Compact Cruiser</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/varla-wasp-electric-scooter-front-view.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Contrary to Varla's previous eScooter offerings, the Wasp has fairly modest specifications. I say this because <a href=#>the Varla Eagle One I reviewed</a> was an absolute beast of a device, capable of zooming along multiple surfaces at insanely high speeds. The Wasp comes in a black matte finish, and has white detailing, including the Varla logo.</p><p>The Wasp is an altogether more relaxed affair, with specifications suited to city commuting rather than off-road, high-speed riding. It is pretty compact, with dimensions sitting at 42 inches overall length, 41 inches high, and a handlebar width of 21 inches.</p><p>The deck is also fairly compact, as a result, measuring 23 inches long and 6 inches wide. The Wasp is comparatively lightweight as it is mainly aluminum alloy in construction. It tips the scales at 33 lbs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/varla-wasp-electric-scooter-folded.jpg><p>In terms of its general appearance, you can expect the Varla Wasp to look like most other eScooters. It has a rear wheel with a mudguard and disc brake, which you can press down for additional breaking, then the deck with the charging point on the left side (the battery is below the deck).</p><p>At the front is the front wheel (duh) with an electric braking system that kicks in when you operate the rear brake. Above this is the handlebar stem locking mechanism, the stem itself (with a light fixed to the front), then the handlebars.</p><p>The handlebar is where you'll find the controls. From left to right, you have the disc brake lever, the controls for power on, the turn signal and the horn, a central ride computer with ODO and battery indicator, as well as a thumb throttle with an integrated power switch on the right.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=city-conscious-specs>City-Conscious Specs</h2><p>I mentioned Varla has designed the Wasp with city commuting in mind. Given the specifications, it would also be suitable for a beginner:</p><ul><li><strong>Motor:</strong> 350 W</li><li><strong>Max. Speed:</strong> 16 MPH</li><li><strong>Battery:</strong> 36V 7.5Ah</li><li><strong>Range:</strong> 19 miles</li><li><strong>Brake:</strong> Rear disc brake and front electronic brake</li><li><strong>Tire:</strong> 8.5 inch pneumatic</li><li><strong>Display:</strong> LED display</li><li><strong>Shock Absorbers:</strong> Rear spring shock absorber</li><li><strong>Charge Time:</strong> 4-5 hours (advertised)</li><li><strong>Maximum Capacity:</strong> 265 lbs</li><li><strong>Ingress Protection:</strong> IP54</li></ul><p>So, these are all fairly reserved specifications, as mentioned. But how is it in use?</p><h2 id=varla-wasp-use-and-performance>Varla Wasp Use and Performance</h2><p>As a city commuter, it works fairly well, but it does have some features I have quibbles with, and I'll detail those here.</p><p>Let's talk about the positive points first. At 33 lbs, the scooter is pretty lightweight—and foldable. This makes it carry around. So, if you decide you will use it to ride to the subway or bus stop, you'll be able to lift it around when you need to. Storing it on said transport may be a little tricky, though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/varla-wasp-electric-scooter-front-wheel.jpg><p>Despite its fairly low speed (this is a commuter scooter, don't forget), the Wasp doesn't feel slow. Given its small size, it is fairly rapid and feels so. Therefore, you won't encounter disappointment as you zip to work or the local store to grab a few groceries. It is a great little scooter for short journeys.</p><p>The Wasp also has pneumatic tires, unlike the aforementioned Eagle One. This is great; they are puncture resistant because of their solid nature, so there's no downtime when you need to change a tire, which is notoriously difficult with eScooters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Braking is very efficient, and you can come to a smooth, controlled stop with ease. Personally, I didn't feel any forward lurching when I was braking. However, with a maximum speed of 16 MPH, you're not really going fast enough to be thrown into mid-air every time you slow the scooter down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/varla-wasp-electric-scooter-left-turn-signal.jpg><p>The scooter comes with turn signals, which is practically unheard of for eScooters in this price bracket. This is an excellent touch, and I commend Varla on doing this, as it is an excellent safety feature. Even a lot of more expensive eScooters don't have turning signals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The LED light is nice and strong, although I found that actually toggling the light on and off was fairly difficult. I don't know if I was just timing it poorly, but the control for the lights (the button in the center of the drive computer) doesn't feel responsive enough for me. On several occasions, I was double pressing the button repeatedly until the timing was just right to toggle the light.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/varla-wasp-electric-scooter-ride-computer.jpg><p>This button also controls the speeds, and this is where my main gripe with the Wasp manifests itself (you can see it at the bottom of the central display in the above image). You can't change the speeds during riding, at least not with ease—especially as the button isn't super responsive. Not only that, but changing the gear requires you to remove your leading hand from the handlebar to press the button, which is a dangerous action on a moving eScooter. The manual itself warns you not to do this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thus, in order to change the maximum speed, you need to slow right down or stop completely, which isn't practical, in my opinion. You don't want to ride at top speed at all times, for battery efficiency and maximizing range, so it led me to question this design decision from Varla. I was told:</p><p>... the Wasp is specifically designed for city commuters who prioritize safety over speed and therefore requires them to gradually slow down to a near stop before shifting gears.</p><p>So, there is Varla's explanation of the speed button location. I still think it is impractical to have to slow down to a near stop, or stop entirely, before you can change the speeds. The Eagle One had a toggle on the thumb control, which was super easy to operate. I'm not a fan of the new method of shifting speeds, I have to admit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/varla-wasp-electric-scooter-controls.jpg><p>There is a control for the horn and the lights on the left, as I mentioned earlier, and Varla could just as easily have popped the speed control on here instead of in the middle of the handlebars, or have you double-press the physical power button to toggle speed. Or they could have integrated the speed button into the right throttle, as with the Eagle One.</p><p>Another, more minor, complaint is the inability to remove the battery. This is a scooter designed for commuters, so it would also be more practical if the battery was removable, making it easier to charge when you're sat at your work desk, for example, where you are likely to have access to a socket to plug it into. Rather than have to place the entire scooter near the charging source.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/varla-wasp-electric-scooter-thumb-throttle.jpg><p>Some people might find the range a little on the low side. However, as this is for city commuting, the assumption is that you shouldn't need to go more than a few miles in one journey, anyway. However, not using the speeds effectively, which I personally found to be a difficult task, will shorten that range.</p><p>At this price, though, one shouldn't expect to be getting much more range out of an eScooter.</p><p>In general, we have a fairly competent eScooter in terms of performance. I just struggle to get past that speed toggle placement. I also think it should be a physical button, not capacitive, so you know you've actually pressed it because it will click. Sorry, Varla.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=would-i-recommend-the-varla-wasp>Would I Recommend the Varla Wasp?</h2><p>Based on what I have just said about the speed toggle placement, this is a difficult one. Removing your hand from the handlebar is dangerous, and I can't imagine a commuter wanting to do that. However, if you slow down before changing speeds, you should find it a pleasurable experience.</p><p>I would also recommend it for a beginner. Thanks to its easy acceleration and great braking, a beginner will quickly gain confidence in riding the Varla Wasp, and it doesn't go so fast that it will be a scary experience for a newbie.</p><p>However, if you are an experienced scooter user, you might want something with a bit more beef, even if it is for commuting. If this is the case, then the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Varla Pegasus</a> or the new <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Varla Falcon</a> would be a better option, with more range and a higher top speed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGitmqqclnq4rdKpZJ6rk6S8tbHRZqmerpmaxHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./drake-leads-the-2024-bet-noms.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Drake Leads The 2024 BET Noms">&larr;

It wasn't until I was 19 or 20 years old I came out, so I'm used to the homophobic comments anyways.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The actor added that he found it a struggle to 'separate himself from the character' due to his role being similar to his real life.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He continued: 'It made the experience very difficult reading the comments because I love social media and interacting with the majority of the show's fans but I couldn't separate myself from the character.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Even though I'm playing a character, a lot of that role is who I am and represents me and that is how I know it is so important for any gay kid watching the show.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-cbef9b30f3e61885 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/05/08/17/70734401-12059749-Positives_However_he_added_that_he_understands_when_a_big_lead_a-a-22_1683563970644.jpg height=838 width=634 alt="Positives: The actor explained that he understands when a 'big lead actor' takes on a gay role because it can 'bring awareness' to the LGBTQ+ community" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Positives: The actor explained that he understands when a 'big lead actor' takes on a gay role because it can 'bring awareness' to the LGBTQ+ community</p><img id=i-370c9834309e9a01 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/05/08/17/70733995-12059749-Opening_up_In_an_exclusive_interview_with_MailOnline_Aidan_said_-a-21_1683563965442.jpg height=758 width=634 alt="In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Aidan said: 'I would say I'm leaning towards a gay guy should play a gay guy'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Aidan said: 'I would say I'm leaning towards a gay guy should play a gay guy'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'When people attack Rick they are attacking the entire LGBTQ community they are saying you are not accepted.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It is such a shame and it is surprising it still exists.

It's so easy to focus on the negatives sometimes and I think we all do that on social media but we have to learn to flip that switch and focus on the positives.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Netflix is set to drop season 16 of Heartland later this month and Aidan revealed fans will see a 'more vulnerable side' to his role.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The actor said he thinks 'it is pretty iconic for the writers to take such a risk' with his character in the new series.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said: 'I'm really excited for it to come out because we shot it last summer, my mum and grandparents are like, "when can we see it?, I think half of my friends don't believe I'm actually on the tele.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I think fans are definitely going to see a more vulnerable side to my character this season. With him being the first LGBTQ+ character in the shows 16 years history I think it is pretty iconic for the writers to take that risk with my character.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I think with the first two or three seasons that I've been in it's been a&nbsp;caricature leaning into the general queer characters we see on TV its there for comedy and its never the hero story.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'This year they have wanted to show the more humanity level of Rick, we will see him possibly adopting a baby.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We are going to be introduced to his on screen husband because that has been alluded for two years and it's been like "well where is he?" We will see a different side of him there and he will take charge in the work place as well.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When he first landed the role, Aidan thought it was just 'a throw away character' but he now sees it as a 'responsibility to use his voice' to allow families watching the show to have open conversations about&nbsp;sexuality.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He believes that the show network 'is very inclusive and diverse' but the reason it took so long to introduce a gay character to Heartland was down to the 'very toxic masculine environment' of rodeos, cowboys and cowgirls.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Aidan explained: 'I think the network is very inclusive and diverse but this show in particular is specific to a western culture that is a very masculine and also a toxic masculine environment, so I think they had to tread very very carefully.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-1d770783cd11b764 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/05/08/17/70734009-12059749-_Such_a_shame_Following_Aidan_joining_Heartland_four_seasons_ago-a-19_1683563958360.jpg height=513 width=634 alt="'Such a shame': Following Aidan joining Heartland four seasons ago, his role has introduced storylines such as gay marriage and adoption" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>'Such a shame': Following Aidan joining Heartland four seasons ago, his role has introduced storylines such as gay marriage and adoption</p><img id=i-6305e69186a36ea5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/05/08/17/70734001-12059749-_Treading_very_carefully_He_believes_that_the_show_network_is_ve-a-20_1683563960394.jpg height=445 width=634 alt="'Treading very carefully': He believes the reason it took so long to introduce a gay character to Heartland was down to the 'very toxic masculine environment' of western cowboys and rodeos" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>'Treading very carefully': He believes the reason it took so long to introduce a gay character to Heartland was down to the 'very toxic masculine environment' of western cowboys and rodeos</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Also I think people in those communities who are part of LGBTQ have never had many characters they could draw upon.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'More and more we need to push to be able to see us in every situation so people feel comfortable and safe coming out in those communities.

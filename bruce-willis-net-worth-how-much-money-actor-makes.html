The esteemed entertainer has a massive net worth to show for his legendary Hollywood career. </span><b>Keep scrolling for details on how much money he has earned over the years.&nbsp;</b></p><h2><b>What Is Bruce Willis’ Net Worth?</b></h2><p><span>Bruce has an estimated net worth of $250 million, according to </span><a href=#><span>Celebrity Net Worth</span></a><span>. One of the German-born actor’s earliest roles was in the 1985 comedy-drama series </span><i><span>Moonlighting</span></i><span>. He starred opposite </span><b>Cybill Shepherd</b><span> on the show for five seasons and earned both a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award for his role as David Addison Jr.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bruce-Willis-Net-Worth-How-Much-Money-Actor-Makes.jpg><p><span>Eventually, Bruce landed the role of John McClane in the</span><i><span> Die Hard</span></i><span> franchise, the portrayal that truly established him as one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood. The last installment of the series, </span><i><span>A Good Day to Die Hard</span></i><span>, was released in 2013. He never expected to return to the big screen as the iconic action hero well into his 50s.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Did I think at the time that 25 years later I would still be making these films?” Bruce told </span><a href=#><i><span>USA Today</span></i></a> <span>in February 2013. “You should call the president of the United States and ask him what’s going to happen 25 years from now. No one has any idea.”</span></p><p><span>He also appeared in other blockbusters like 1994’s </span><i><span>Pulp Fiction</span></i><span>, 1997’s </span><i><span>The Fifth Element</span></i><span>, 1998’s </span><i><span>Armageddon</span></i><span> and 1999’s </span><i><span>The Sixth Sense</span></i><span>. The action star earned another Emmy Award in 2000 for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his role as Paul Stevens on </span><i><span>Friends</span></i><span>. Throughout his acting career, Bruce performed as a musician under the pseudonym Bruno Radolini. In 2015, the performer made his Broadway debut in </span><i><span>Misery</span></i><span>, a stage adaptation of </span><b>Stephen King</b><span>’s novel of the same name.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Some of his final acting roles prior to his retirement included appearances in </span><i><span>Paradise City</span></i><span>, the </span><i><span>Detective Knight </span></i><span>trilogy, </span><i><span>White Elephant</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Vendetta</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>How Many Kids Does Bruce Willis Have?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>Bruce met his first wife, </span><a href=#><b>Demi Moore</b></a><span>, in 1987 at a screening of the film </span><i><span>Stakeout</span></i><span>. They got married that same year. The </span><i><span>General Hospital </span></i><span>alum and the </span><i><span>Sin City</span></i><span> actor welcomed their first child together, daughter <a href=#>Rumer</a>, in 1988. Their second daughter, Scout, was born in 1991 followed by their third daughter, Tallulah, in 1994.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Bruce and Demi divorced in 2000. He married his second wife,</span><b> Emma Heming Willis</b><span>, in 2009. In 2012, the </span><i><span>Touching Evil </span></i><span>producer became a dad for the fourth time when Emma gave birth to their daughter <a href=#>Mabel.</a> Their youngest daughter, Evelyn, was born in 2014.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Why Did Bruce Willis Retire From Acting?</b></h2><p><span>In March 2022, Emma, Demi and the three eldest Willis children shared a post on Instagram to let fans know Bruce was retiring from acting after being diagnosed with aphasia, a communication disorder.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“To Bruce’s amazing supporters, as a family, we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities,” they wrote. “As a result of this and with much consideration, Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.”</span></p><p><span>Nearly a year later in February 2023, the family gave another update on Bruce’s health and shared details about his road ahead.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Since we announced Bruce’s diagnosis of aphasia in spring 2022, Bruce’s condition has progressed and we now have a more specific diagnosis: frontotemporal dementia (known as FTD),” the statement read. “Unfortunately, challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease Bruce faces. While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46bqa6blWLEqrjLoqpmppWperi70a2fZqCfrHquwcKhZKannprGbq3CraarZZ2WuKa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./candice-swanepoel-adds-her-own-twist-to-the-naked-dress.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Candice Swanepoel wears naked dress">&larr;

Aikman is a former American football quarterback who was active in the National Football League for 12 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys.&nbsp;</p><p>He later transferred from Oklahoma and played college football at UCLA, where he won the Davey O’Brien Award as a senior. The first woman he married was Rhonda Worthey, which made her famous.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rhonn.jpg><p>The former couple spent years together and welcomed two kids before things ended. The divorce hearing was kept discreet, and it happened in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>After the split, Worthey has remained single, but her former husband has given love another chance by marrying again. Nevertheless, the pair stay cordial and co-parent their kids well.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Meet_Rhonda_Worthey></span>Meet Rhonda Worthey<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rhonda Worthey was born in November 1968 in Paris, Texas. She married Troy Aikman when she was 31. However, before she met him, Worthey had been married once.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rhonda-aikman-net-worth.jpeg><p>She was the wife of a man whom she welcomed her first child, a daughter with. They married in the suburbs of North Dallas, where he reportedly came from. After their marriage ended, Worthey moved on with Aikman.&nbsp;</p><p>Worthey married Aikman in April 2000, but the wedding was simple. They only invited their closest friends and family. It was an intimate ceremony held in their home one Saturday at noon.&nbsp;</p><p>They later celebrated the nuptials with more people surrounded by yellow and pink flowers. One year after their marriage, Aikman announced that he was retiring from the NFL during a press conference on April 9, 2001.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Details_of_Rhonda_Wortheys_Divorce_From_Aikman></span>Details of Rhonda Worthey’s Divorce From Aikman&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rhonda Worthey and Troy Aikman announced their decision to get separated in January 2011 after a decade of marriage. They released a joint statement that <a href=#>read</a>:&nbsp;</p><p>“We remain deeply committed to our children … during this adjustment period.”</p><p>A few months before their official separation, the couple was already dividing the family assets. According to reports, Worthy surrendered her stake in the family house they had in Dallas, then, a few months later, bought a home for about $1.5 million.&nbsp;</p><p>In legal documents obtained by TMZ, Worthey’s marriage to Aikman was officially dissolved on April 12, 2011. In 2012, Aikman paid $1.75 million as part of their marital property agreement.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_to_Rhonda_Worthey_Troys_First_Wife></span>What Happened to Rhonda Worthey, Troy’s First Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Not long after her divorce from Aikman was finalized, Rhonda Worthey was found in breach of the law. It happened in August 2012, and she got arrested for public intoxication after cops found her in a high school parking lot in Texas.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/troy.jpg><p>It was on a Monday morning, and officers of the Murphy Police Department were dispatched to McMillen High School because a suspicious car was sighted in the school parking lot.&nbsp;</p><p>When they arrived, the cops found Worthey in the driver’s seat with the ignition turned off. The police reported that she had “fumbled” out of the vehicle with “a strong odor of alcohol” coming from it.&nbsp;</p><p>Though her words were slurring, Worthey denied being intoxicated. However, according to the cops’ report, she could barely control her body’s movement.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Worthey_Threw_Her_Ex-Husbands_Name_Around_a_Lot></span>Worthey Threw Her Ex-Husband’s Name Around a Lot<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the end, she refused to step out of her car. The officers had to “forcefully” remove and detain her after they deemed her a danger to herself and others.&nbsp;</p><p>In a video that captured Worthey’s arrest, she can be heard <a href=#>saying</a>: “If you do this, it’ll be on the TV… it’s going to hurt Troy; it’s going [to] hurt me. Is that what your goal is?”</p><p>In her car, two bottles containing a yellow liquid that smelled like alcohol, a prescription drug used to treat seizures and panic attacks, and a small dog were found. Worthey was later transported to the police station and then released afterward.&nbsp;</p><p>A man who claimed to have been dating her said she had been on her way to her mother’s house when she lost her way, which is how she ended up in the high school parking lot.&nbsp;Worthey pleaded “no contest” to her charge and got 30 days of probation in exchange.</p><p>Worthey has lived quietly ever since, more focused on being a great parent to her daughters. Aikman, like many other NFL retirees, including <a href=#>Terry Crews</a>, remains active in the world of sports and is doing well for himself.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02apoaeema5uw86rq6GdqWLBs7vYZpiio52Wu7R5xaKprKxdrLansYywn6hlm5qysb%2BMmmSlp6divbO7xaKjnmc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./celebrities-rooting-for-chiefs-super-bowl.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="12 Celebrities Who Are Rooting For The Chiefs At The Super Bowl">&larr;

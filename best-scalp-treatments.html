But do you have a scalp care regimen?&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the important role that the scalp plays, it often goes neglected, which can disrupt the delicate balance of the skin in this area. When your scalp’s microbiome isn’t functioning properly, hair won’t grow to its full potential, and can result in irritation, flakes, and plain discomfort.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thankfully, beauty brands have taken note. Until recently, scalp care was almost exclusively focused on dandruff treatments, but there’s been a shift. Now, formulas are designed to maintain, soothe, nourish, clarify, and stimulate the scalp. There’s truly something for everyone —&nbsp;all you have to do is find your perfect match. Here, we’ve curated a selection of the best scalp treatments for every concern, plus tapped experts to break down exactly how to give this special skin precisely what it needs.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-rahua-founders-blend-scalp--hair-treatment></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rahua Founder's Blend Scalp & Hair Treatment</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Rahua Founder's Blend Scalp &amp;amp; Hair Treatment" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-YD78ZZxADtp6QJhML_sivrXb1c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Rahua-Founders-Blend-Scalp--Hair-Treatment-7bec3fca3a6a4d0c8ba58df71f32bec4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This creamy triple-acting formula balances, refreshes, and nourishes the scalp.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>When used primarily as a hair treatment, you’ll burn through the bottle quickly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For years we’ve listened to our peers wax poetic about Rahua products, and after trying this formula, we couldn’t believe we waited so long to try the brand for ourselves. This buttery treatment melts into the scalp, deeply nourishing it with omega-rich oils, including rahua and hemp. At the same time, palo santo, peppermint, and rosemary oils rebalance the microbiome to combat dandruff and itching (and also lend a lovely herbal fragrance). The powerful combination provides an energizing tingling sensation, so the treatment really feels like it’s working.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once rinsed out (either after 20 minutes or a good night’s rest), the visible difference is astonishing: Flakes rinse away, irritation is quelled, and hair has more volume at the root, which results in bouncier blowouts once strands are dried and styled.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we primarily use this as a scalp revitalizer, it also acts as a hair treatment that boosts strength and shine. However, be aware that the bottle is relatively small, and if you have long hair you’ll likely run out quickly. To get the most out of the formula, we recommend focusing your application on the scalp — save full masking for special occasions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Cream<strong>｜Active Ingredients: </strong>Rahua oil, palo santo oil, hemp oil<strong>｜Size: </strong>1.3 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-the-ordinary-multi-peptide-serum-for-hair-density></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The Ordinary Multi-Peptide Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Ordinary Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/l_wAniZM521seIHDk20Bu50g9bU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/The-Ordinary-Multi-Peptide-Serum-for-Hair-Density-e42df647adb542d58ddc2a4db0cff9e8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This formula is packed with proprietary lab-developed ingredients that are proven to promote hair growth.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It has an unusual scent and can leave hair greasy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s a rarity to find an affordable scalp product with so many effective and clinically-proven ingredients, yet The Ordinary created one — and it’s seriously impressive. The Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density combines the power of three potent ingredients, including Redensyl, a favorite board-certified dermatologist Dr. Ava Shamban.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Redensyl is a botanical 'growth galvanizer' that will give minoxidil and finasteride [hair growth drugs] a run for their money,” Dr. Shamban says. Beyond this revolutionary ingredient, the serum also contains Procapil, which promotes blood circulation to nourish the hair follicle, and Baicapil that thickens hair in just a few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Contents aside, we admit that it has a peculiar smell (which we liken to beer), and the greasy texture can leave hair looking a little dirty. That said, the scent fades quickly, and if you use this as a night treatment before wash day you’ll get all the benefits without the oily feeling.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Serum<strong>｜Active Ingredients: </strong>Caffeine,<strong> </strong>redensyl, procapil, baicapil<strong>｜Size: </strong>2 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-wethrivv-revivv-for-her-hair-rejuvenation-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>WeThrivv Revivv For Her Hair Rejuvenation Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon WeThrivv Revivv For Her Hair Rejuvenation Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ujhJi6Qb7Tsh979JcR67nxPy5rE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Revivv-For-Her-Hair-Rejuvenation-Serum-c128b9e997584b829f192588580cfc37.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This water-based serum can be applied to clean hair without messing up your style.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It can only be purchased in a three-month supply.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve been hooked on this serum since its debut for a multitude of reasons. What first grabbed us was the packaging: The rollerball bottle makes for an easy, mess-free application that allows us to glide the product right where we want it. As for the formula, it’s water-based and dries like it, with zero stickiness or crunchiness, so it can be applied on freshly-styled hair without disrupting your ‘do.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yet perhaps the most impressive aspect of the formula are the clinical results. In a clinical study with 150 participants, 80 percent found that their hair growth, density, and scalp coverage improved, while 90 percent saw new hair growth, and 100 percent observed decreased shedding. Even better, every ingredient in the formula is clean, with bio-developed and plant-based ingredients shown to support healthy hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although the formula is an investment, it’s also a great value: You’ll get two bottles, which equates to a three-month supply.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Serum<strong>｜Active Ingredients: </strong>Green tea extract, caffeine, copper peptides<strong>｜Size: </strong>1.01 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-seborrheic-dermatitis-and-psoriasis-neutrogena-tgel-therapeutic-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Seborrheic Dermatitis and Psoriasis</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Neutrogena T/Gel Therapeutic Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Neutrogena T/Gel Therapeutic Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mnk5HlD5EWRKszy45VuV93XSgZ8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Neutrogena-T-Gel-Therapeutic-Shampoo-9d46cc02f0684197b8c372121772fa6f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This formula instantly soothes itching.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It has a very strong smell.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re dealing with a common scalp condition, including seborrheic dermatitis or psoriasis, using a formula with coal tar can soothe the inflamed, irritated skin and restore its microbiome. “Coal tar is a top ingredient that helps to suppress the issue [of flaking],” says Dr. Shamban.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This affordable formula from Neutrogena has long been an in-shower staple for those suffering from scaly scalps. (It even earned one of the top spots in our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dandruff shampoos test</a>.) Regular use relieves itching and inflammation and slows hyperproliferation of skin cells. Additionally, it also helps combat the yeast growth that contributes to the development of seborrheic dermatitis.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This shampoo is incredibly effective, so it’s worth powering through the strong scent, which is rather rubbery (not unlike a set of tires). That said, it is a medicated shampoo, so we wouldn’t expect it to smell like roses anyway. Following your cleanse with a pleasantly-fragranced conditioner or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair perfume</a> will mask the odor (and besides, it fades pretty quickly).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Shampoo<strong>｜Active Ingredients: </strong>Coal tar<strong>｜Size: </strong>16 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dry-scalps-dr-barbara-sturm-balancing-scalp-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Dry Scalps</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Barbara Sturm Balancing Scalp Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dr. Barbara Sturm Balancing Scalp Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nVM8w9jaxbTfVRAzXEQvkW5xRgQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Dr.-Barbara-Sturm-Balancing-Scalp-Serum-62fd7c78becd4fbfad53aa2d12971909.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dr. Barbara Sturm</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The formula rehydrates a stripped scalp with a robust form of hyaluronic acid.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It can sometimes leave hair feeling sticky.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dry scalps can lead to flaking and itchiness. To minimize those symptoms and help your scalp maintain optimum moisture levels, scalp therapist and trichologist Bridgette Hill recommends this hydrating treatment that was formulated with a unique hyaluronic acid structure. “Cationic hyaluronic acid assists with retaining moisture; a key factor in reducing dry, flaky, inflamed, and irritated scalps,” she says. The luxe serum also contains two forms of algae and lavender to soothe itching and relieve dryness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hill loves the serum for all people who want to rehydrate their scalps, including dudes. “It’s a must for men who have shaved bald heads to keep the skin on the scalp supple and healthy,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You might find that this formula can leave a sticky residue behind. If this is a major concern, try applying it before bed. The serum will fully absorb overnight, and any tackiness will be gone by morning.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Serum<strong>｜Active Ingredients: </strong>Cationic hyaluronic acid, algae extract, purslane extract<strong>｜Size: </strong>1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-oily-scalps-oribe-serene-scalp-oil-control-treatment-mist></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Oily Scalps</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Oribe Serene Scalp Oil Control Treatment Mist</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Oribe Serene Scalp Oil Control Treatment Mist" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Ch1qfxdwhg18hHxbP-rhcVIEVMo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Oribe-Serene-Scalp-Oil-Control-Treatment-Mist-35dfa80c7bae48439aec76c2aa8f2e81.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s wonderful for staving off oil slicks in fine hair types.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The spray format doesn’t allow for precise application.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Inside this pretty lilac bottle you’ll find a hardworking formula designed to tackle excess oil, especially on straight and wavy strands. It uses a blend of rosebay and green algae extracts to control greasiness and rebalance the scalp, peppermint oil to cool and soothe, and, surprisingly enough, willowherb extract. Willowherb is frequently found in oily and acne-prone skincare products because it tames oil, supports the microbiome, and mattifies. Here it does those exact same things for your scalp.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The treatment is a thicker cream-liquid, and the spray nozzle packaging isn’t very compatible with the texture. Spritzing directly onto hair can cause buildup and create an unexpectedly greasy look. We find that spraying the product onto our fingertips then massaging it into our scalp produces the best results and allows us to extend time between washes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Spray<strong>｜Active Ingredients: </strong>Rosebay extract, green algae extract, ginger extract<strong>｜Size: </strong>4.2 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-itchy-scalps-stripes-the-root-of-it-ectoine-calming--thickening-scalp-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Itchy Scalps</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Stripes Ectoine Calming & Thickening Scalp Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Stripes The Root of It Ectoine Calming &amp;amp; Thickening Scalp Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sXaeLGo-aH2ZX4MejsoSZi3X0RU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Stripes-The-Root-of-It-Ectoine-Calming--Thickening-Scalp-Serum-1a0ac5b925a942b88aa341ddf1894237.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This serum contains ecotine, a gentle anti-inflammatory ingredient that moisturizes the scalp.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The dropper can be hard to control.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anyone can experience scalp issues, but the possibility increases during menopause. Naomi Watts' sought to produce a solution for those dealing with skin-related hormonal fluctuations during this life change, and that’s how this serum was born.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The nourishing formula addresses multiple concerns — beyond those associated with menopause. Though, it really excels in rebalancing itchy, irritated scalps. The core ingredient is ultra-soothing ectoine, a newly-popular emollient that helps dry skin retain moisture while repairing and supporting the skin barrier.

Powered by pyrithione zinc, an ingredient found in many of the brand’s formulas due to its exceptional ability to combat dandruff, this cream was specially designed for those with curly and coily hair who face unique challenges when treating their scalps.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Those with curly hair require more time between washes than those with straight hair, as the oil needs to travel along corkscrew-shaped strands to moisturize all the way to the ends,” explains board-certified hair restoration surgeon Dr. Craig Ziering. That can result in a flaky scalp that’s difficult to treat between washes without dehydrating it. The defined applicator administers the cream right to the source of the issue, making it use in between washes without disrupting your style.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond treating dandruff, it also minimizes dryness with coconut oil.

The ingredient does double-duty as a treatment and a fragrance: It smells delicious as it’s massaged in, but it also feels invigorating, heating up then cooling down to comfort and soothe. With regular use, the scalp starts to self-balance and hair grows thicker, glossier, and healthier.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We will note that this is an oil-based product, which isn’t a bad thing — that’s what makes it nourishing.

However, completing a scalp rinse with pure ACV isn’t particularly enjoyable to either our head or our nose. (Trust us, we’ve tried.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thankfully, Act+Acre found a way to combine the benefits of apple cider vinegar without the sharp odor, and we are forever grateful. This shampoo taps a potent derivative of ACV — apple amino acids —&nbsp;to accomplish the same goal as a traditional stinky rinse, with a fraction of the scent. And with a dash of ylang ylang oil, it carries a subtle floral and refreshing fragrance.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-98 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the lack of sulfates, the cleanser lathers impressively well and rinses out easily with no residue left behind. If you commit to using this formula, you may find that its scalp rebalancing properties will allow you to extend the time between wash days, especially if you double cleanse. (The first shampoo loosens product build-up, flakes and grime from the scalp, and the second ensures it’s all removed from the head.) We should note that the shampoo requires an adjustment period, during which your scalp may feel drier than usual. Power through the first few washes — your scalp will thank you in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Shampoo<strong>｜Active Ingredients: </strong>Apple amino acids, baobab oil, ylang ylang oil<strong>｜Size: </strong>10 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overnight-virtue-topical-scalp-supplement></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overnight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Virtue Topical Scalp Supplement</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Virtue Topical Scalp Supplement" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2v4soWgbiKghOaC77ZCeu-CHydo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Virtue-Topical-Scalp-Supplement-244ea205beec4df8b39f8a0302486524.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Spritz this supercharged mist all over your scalp and roots and the human-identical keratin protein will do the rest — fast.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Don’t overspray, unless you’re fine with sticky hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-102 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s rare that beauty begins on the battlefield, but that’s exactly what happened here. Dr. Luke Burnett, a retired U.S. Army Colonel, and his team in a regenerative medicine lab were researching how to heal injuries from combat. What they discovered was a way to collect keratin in its pure form, Alpha Keratin 60ku, which has the power to treat burn wounds and regrow tissue. And since this keratin is identical to the type we have in our hair, skin and nails, it binds directly to repair the scalp and strands, supporting new, fragile and damaged hair so each strand thickens and grows.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-103 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Along with a nutrient-dense blend of peptides, prebiotics, and vitamins, this fast-absorbing mist kickstarts lazy follicles. In fact, 100 percent of women who participated in an independent third-party clinical study said that after six months, their existing hair grew faster, while 97 percent saw new growth and 94 percent believed their hair looked fuller.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-104 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the most part, the mist doesn’t impact the look or feel of our hair once it’s been sprayed in, and because of its weightless formula, it’s easy to overdo it and could get a little sticky. But if you follow the instructions, working in sections and massaging in, focusing on your scalp, you’ll soak up all the formula’s goodness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-105 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Spray<strong>｜Active Ingredients: </strong>Keratin protein, biomimetic peptides, larch wood extract<strong>｜Size:</strong> 4 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind&nbsp;</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Your Scalp Concerns</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are many conditions that can afflict the scalp, so when selecting your scalp treatment, choose one that targets your exact concerns. But before that, you should figure out the root cause. “All abnormal scalp conditions can be attributed to one or a combination of these factors: Genetics, lifestyle, diet, hair styling habits, environment, health, stress, hormones, and medications,” explains Hill.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the most commonly recognized is dandruff, which is a chronic oily scalp condition related to fungal and bacterial imbalances, says Dr. Ziering. It’s also an inflammatory issue, so limiting inflammatory foods, such as full-fat dairy products and very sugary foods, can help, says Anabel Kingsley, certified trichologist and president of Philip Kingsley.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Seborrheic dermatitis is similar, but it’s dandruff’s “more serious cousin,” says Dr. Shamban. It’s characterized by red scaly patches, inflammation, and very large flakes that are stickier and more challenging to remove than those caused by dandruff. “Dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis are much more likely to occur when excess oils are present, as malassezia yeasts thrive in an oily environment,” says Kingsley. Pyrithione zinc and coal tar (which is the hero in <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Neutrogena T/Gel Therapeutic Shampoo</a>) are two potent ingredients in the fight against these yeasts. “If you have psoriasis, which manifests as large silvery plaques of dead skin, these ingredients can also help relieve it, but psoriasis needs prescription treatments to help manage it,” she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your scalp is prone to dryness, that’s a sign that the skin on your head is craving more moisture. “A dry scalp is usually linked to environmental or external fluctuations and is often a transient issue rather than a chronic one,” says Dr. Ziering. Common causes include weather shifts, stripping hair products, and excessively cleansing your hair. If you suspect your scalp is tired of too many washdays, Dr. Shamban recommends limiting your shampoo sessions to two to three times a week. “This will give your hair and scalp a break as needed,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hair loss is one of the most frustrating scalp concerns that affects both men and women. “It can be caused by genetic conditions, but also by hormonal changes, or exacerbated by scalp conditions,” says Dr. Shamban. There are many ingredients that can help stimulate and prolong the hair growth cycle. Kingsley likes caffeine, minoxidil, and biomimetic peptides, the latter of which help maintain a healthy growth cycle and normalize shedding rates. You can find them in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Virtue Flourish Density Booster</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Shamban also likes the proprietary ingredient Redensyl. “It’s an express ‘route to the root’ of the stem cells, delivering the signal to increase the action of dermal papillae fibroblast metabolism in our follicles,” she says.

It’s blended into <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Oribe Serene Scalp Oil Control Treatment Mist</a>. If you’re managing hair loss, look for saw palmetto. “It slows down 5-alpha reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone into a potent androgen hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT),” says Dr. Shamban. This hormone is known to contribute to hair loss.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Other popular ingredients that you’ll see in scalp care products are the same as ones you might find in your favorite skincare formulas —&nbsp;hyaluronic acid, witch hazel, niacinamide, squalane, and exfoliating alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids.

Remember, “scalp is skin, so treat it as such using active botanicals and cosmeceutical ingredients,” says Dr. Shamban. Kingsley adds that “the scalp is an extension of the skin on your forehead and is exposed to the same stressors and environmental pollution, so it benefits from similar TLC.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hill says to consider what you subject your scalp to on a regular basis (for example, color treating or keratin treatments, and heat styling) as well as its current condition (is it itchy? Flaky? Congested?). Then, select an appropriate scalp mask or pre-treatment for your needs. “Most products recommend a processing time of a minimum of 15 to 30 minutes, but I suggest that clients sleep in their pre-scalp treatments for optimal results,” she says. Invest in a separate pillow and pillowcase just for nights when you use your scalp treatment so as not to ruin your linens.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">How you apply your pre-treatment is just as important as the formula itself. “I encourage clients to activate the scalp muscles and improve circulation with a massage,” says Hill, who recommends using both hands and starting from the nape of your neck up to the crown, then from the base of the ear to the top of the head on both sides. “There’s a lot of area to cover, so take your time,” she adds. “Spend three to five minutes massaging the appropriate oil into the scalp to soften skin cells, exfoliate, and remove debris to encourage blood flow.” Formulas with ingredients like peppermint (found in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Pattern Beauty Scalp Serum</a>), citrus (blended into <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Philip B.

After massaging in the shampoo, let it sit for five minutes, fully wet your hair, and emulsify it, then finish your cleansing regimen with a conditioner. But you’re not done yet. “Finish with a topical water-based serum [like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">WeThrivv Revivv For Her Hair Rejuvenation Serum</a>]&nbsp; or lotion that promotes hair health or addresses your specific scalp concern,” says Hill.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What removes scalp buildup?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Focusing too much on hair care rather than scalp care is a major reason for scalp buildup, says Kingsley. “Simply shampooing regularly and thoroughly will help remove buildup and prevent its occurrence. Spend approximately one minute gently but firmly massaging your scalp when you shampoo and rinse well,” she says. Using a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>clarifying shampoo</a> is also a good way to give your scalp a reset. If you don’t wash your hair every day, double cleanse when you do shampoo to make sure you’re breaking down all the dirt, oil, and grime. You can also use a formula like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Act+Acre Cold Processed Cleanse Shampoo</a>, which uses apple amino acids to remove buildup without stripping the scalp.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, Dr. Shamban says using a pre-shampoo treatment, such as a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>scalp scrub</a>, with salicylic acid will exfoliate the scalp by breaking down any excess dead skin cells and product, as well as lift away any debris. A good one to try is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kérastase Symbiose Scalp Renewal Micro-Exfoliating Scrub</a> which features salicylic acid and physical exfoliants like apricot seed powder. And don’t forget to brush daily, either: “This moves the sebum down the hair shaft, which lessens the build-up at the root,” she says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What causes scalp itchiness?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are many causes of scalp itchiness — some simple, some complicated —&nbsp;so it’s important to get to the root of the issue (pun intended). “Scalp pruritus, or itchy scalp can be as simple as an isolated symptom,” says Hill. It could also be dandruff, dryness, eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, or psoriasis. Usually, you’ll be able to see these issues manifesting on your scalp, with flaking, rashing, or inflammation.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re not seeing anything unusual, it could be due to hormonal shifts within the body. “Many people find their scalp becomes irritated when hormone levels fluctuate — for instance, leading up to menstruation, in early pregnancy, the postpartum period, and upon entering menopause,” says Kingsley. Alternatively, it could be a mild allergy, says Dr. Shamban, which she says can be relieved by taking an over-the-counter antihistamine.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emily Orofino</a> is a beauty writer, editor, and consultant with more than a decade of experience in the industry.

Hormones can affect how your skin reacts to ingredients so you may find you develop reactions to products you've used previously without a problem,"&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Lesley Gilchrist</a>, registered midwife and co-founder of My Expert Midwife explains.</p><p id=eHZtXdUFjdAD data-wc=27>"You may experience breakouts of acne, sensitivity, rashes and dryness, and certain ingredients should be avoided during pregnancy as they may cause complications to you and/or baby."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c2aee791e7e2-face-oil-application-z.jpg><p id=e6DqFS8BxtNL data-wc=7><strong>Skin can become more sensitive during pregnancy</strong></p><p id=eQU3M-HloCVI data-wc=22>These include vitamin A derivatives, which are commonly found in anti-aging products, as evidence links vitamin A to problems with babies' development.</p><p id=eD5xsB4Up2V0 data-wc=67>Lesley adds: "Some products such as skin lighteners, brighteners and even some types of nail polishes can contain ingredients which are not recommended for use during pregnancy. Skincare ingredients can be absorbed through the skin and may cross the placenta to your unborn baby, so it's always best to check the product is suitable to use during pregnancy, or if in doubt, seek advice from healthcare professionals."</p><p id=eL7wiMGQGrli data-wc=9><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>20 baby shower themes every mum-to-be will love</a></strong></p><p id=edqyPoLvjjfM data-wc=9><strong>SHOP: <a class=hm-link href=#>Best moisturisers for dry skin with top reviews</a></strong></p><p id=eCbNDU7wdPrR data-wc=46>Meanwhile, you may want to avoid acne-fighting products, which can create overly-dry and flaky skin during pregnancy. These work by drying out the natural oils in the skin, which may already be feeling more sensitive and easily irritated due to pregnancy hormones and increased blood flow.</p><h2>Should essential oils in skincare be avoided in pregnancy?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2f304bb31d31-pregnant-woman-moisturising-z.jpg><p id=eQi8lvhuLd1E data-wc=8><strong>Some essential oils should be avoided during pregnancy</strong></p><p id=eIJ5tTvKNGvV data-wc=32>Essential oils can be found in many of our favourite skincare products, and are something to look out for during pregnancy, as some may cause side effects to you or your baby.</p><p id=eSxF8u7B7mPL data-wc=72>Fran Johnson, Product Development Manager at Neal's Yard Remedies, says: "Using essential oils during pregnancy is a much discussed topic and is highly emotive for obvious reasons! <strong>There are many essential oils that we wouldn't recommend using, however there are some oils that are safe to use and can help with relaxation and some pregnancy symptoms.</strong> Pregnancy massage can be a wonderful experience and can also help to relieve some pregnancy symptoms."</p><p id=e39mCqz8J_uj data-wc=7><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>The 9 best pregnancy workout apps</a></strong></p><p id=eiijZ-w6PSka data-wc=37>Some of the essential oils that are safe to use include Neroli, Eucalyptus, Lavender, Geranium and Frankincense, many of which encourage relaxation and wellness. If in doubt, consult a healthcare professional or aromatherapist before using essential oils.</p><h2>What are the best natural skincare ingredients for pregnancy?</h2><p id=eqxL-J4Zfa8F data-wc=44>"During pregnancy your skin will benefit from extra care and attention, especially if you find it feels more sensitive, has changes in pigmentation, is more prone to rashes and dryness or if you feel your usual products are not working as well," Lesley says.</p><p id=evLkP5vOPsKt data-wc=52><strong>"You may find that switching to products which contain more natural ingredients can help to calm, soothe, balance, protect and hydrate your skin gently without stripping those precious natural oils</strong> - and some can even help improve circulation, minimise cell damage and help reduce constipation when combined with a regular massage routine."</p><p id=en-zNyaMpkn9 data-wc=9><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Game-changer gifts for new mums and expectant parents</a></strong></p><p id=euOtyBI1LQrs data-wc=32>Recommended natural ingredients include shea, aloe, coconut, cocoa, argan, sweet almond, lavender, grapefruit, geranium, avocado, beeswax, vitamins E and C, which can be found in oils, butters, creams and lotions and gels.</p><p id=e5He4_BV3O9o data-wc=35>"They not only work to benefit your skin but often help your mental wellbeing as their properties can include the ability to help you feel calm, energised and relaxed through inhaling their aromas," Lesley adds.</p><h2>Is hyaluronic acid ok during pregnancy?</h2><p id=eZoRs0RZTAj3 data-wc=41>According to research, hyaluronic acid is considered safe to use during pregnancy and can be used liberally. It can be useful as a stretch mark treatment, with some studies finding that applying it to early stretch marks made them less noticeable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/222c96ff5b58-skincare-products-z.jpg><p id=eB1SektmgKrq data-wc=13><strong>Skincare products containing vitamin C and hyaluronic acid are considered safe during pregnancy</strong></p><h2>Is retinol safe during pregnancy?</h2><p id=eDjO1GW60rev data-wc=62>While <a class=hm-link href=#>retinol – a form of vitamin A – is a popular skincare ingredient</a> for tackling everything from acne to increasing collagen, it is not safe to use during pregnancy or when breastfeeding. This is because the topical use of retinol or retinoids may contribute to high levels of vitamin A in the body, which could cause serious harm to a fetus.</p><h2>What serums are safe during pregnancy?</h2><p id=eykgrhAnmNxV data-wc=30><strong>Serums with ingredients such as vitamin C or hyaluronic acid are considered safe to use during pregnancy&nbsp;</strong>and may be beneficial to expectant mothers experiencing dry skin or dark spots.</p><h2>What sunscreen is safe during pregnancy?</h2><p id=e4n0VazH2gf4 data-wc=50>Keeping out of strong sunlight is recommended during pregnancy to prevent skin issues such as <a class=hm-link href=#>dark spots or melasma</a>, hyperpigmentation and discoloration. You should also continue using sunscreen to protect your skin from harmful UVA and UVB rays, but may want to be more conscious of what products you're using.</p><p id=eTYn5E_wFT8t data-wc=9><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>The best rated SPF sunscreens for your face</a></strong></p><p id=e4mqQQpcR5Sl data-wc=32>The ingredient oxybenzone should be avoided, with mineral sunscreens containing zinc oxide or titanium dioxide considered a better choice during pregnancy.

It can be stressful, then, to find a stylist who is capable of creating the perfect style while making the experience fun and personable.</p><p>Luckily for Pine Belt residents, the search for just such a hair and makeup artist is not difficult. In Petal, Laurel native Abbey Kuespert runs several accounts promoting her work as a makeup artist, especially her work preparing brides for their special day.</p><p>Makeup by Abbey Elizabeth has 24,000 followers on her Facebook account and 6,000 followers on her Instagram page @Makeupby_AbbeyElizabeth. The 29-year-old works with clients for high school homecoming makeup to full bridal makeovers and everything in between, capturing it all for her platform and followers.</p><p>“I love the community of women that I have on my page,” Kuespert said. “It’s mind-blowing to me that I have people who follow me from all over the world and that I’m able to connect with so many amazing girls daily.”</p><p>With more than eight years of experience working in the world of hair and makeup, Kuespert has picked up a thing or two — not just about fashion and makeup, but about greater general life lessons.</p><p>“I attribute success to just being authentic,” she said. “I think in today’s world, everyone wants to create content, but what is really going to make you stand out is being yourself.”</p><p>This drive for authenticity is evident across Kuespert’s platforms. Her captions often read as down-to-earth conversations, like an old friend filling you in on her hobby. Of course, makeup is so much more to her than just a hobby – or even than just a business, for that matter. Makeup is her passion.</p><p>“I started social media around the end of 2016, when I began posting makeup looks and tutorials online to advertise my business,” Kuespert said. “I didn’t really have intentions of growing a big following at that time, but throughout the years, as I began writing and sharing more and more of my life, it just kind of happened. Although I was originally inspired by YouTube beauty gurus I watched when I was younger and a love for makeup, my platform has grown into so much more than just beauty content.”</p><p>Kuespert’s platform isn’t just limited to the realm of blush, blenders and braids, though. Often, across all three of her pages, Abbey finds a different way to connect with her audience and exercise one of her other great passions — writing.</p><p>“I used to try to force myself to do videos to keep up with trends,” she said, “but I am much more of a writer.”</p><p>This comes back, again, to Kuespert’s belief in authenticity. While she is talented with hair and makeup, that isn’t her only passion. She loves to write and has many things that she simply has to write about, she said, from stories and celebrations with her family to gratitude for those who come to her as clients and always leave as friends. Another favorite topic is her faith.</p><p>“I also love to share my faith online a lot,” Kuespert said, “and I try to put God first in all that I do and make that known.”</p><p>That writing comes from a deeply passionate place, she said, adding that she hopes to expand this passion on her platforms in the future.</p><p>“I definitely don’t see myself ever not writing,” Kuespert said, “but I’m sure the topics I write about will change as I enter new seasons of my life. I’d love to eventually branch out and start a podcast.”</p><p>Kuespert’s platforms are fittingly similar to her clientele – or her new work friends, as she might say– in that her passion has helped in transforming both into the authentic beauties they always could be. Makeup isn’t about taking the authentic and making it beautiful, but taking something already beautiful and adding authentic touches with patience and passion. It’s like famed fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent said: “The most beautiful makeup of a woman is passion.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcK2MrKacoZGheq6xw6KYZqWRoLKwwsSrZpqqpJ6wrbG%2BnpidcGRtgKZ5w25vb2VhZrKmeZienW9lYJeucYKScWtunpNse6nAzKU%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-exit-safe-mode-on-windows-10.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Exit Safe Mode on Windows 10">&larr;

The music star is the wife of James Brolin, and they have a blended family, including stepson Josh Brolin, with whom she has a unique relationship.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Over the years Barbra Streisand and her stepson, Josh Brolin, have come to love and cherish the presence of each other in their blended family. Their stepmother-stepson relationship is unlike any other, and they have proved this many times.</p><p>Fans on social media have seen them shower love on each other, and on several occasions, Streisand and her stepson have shown immense support in their careers. Here’s a look through their interesting relationship.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/streisand-brolin.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=inside-barbra-streisand-s-marriage-and-family-life><span class=ez-toc-section id=Inside_Barbra_Streisands_Marriage_and_Family_Life></span>Inside Barbra Streisand’s Marriage and Family Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Streisand and James Brolin <a href=#>became husband and wife in 1996, </a>bringing together a blended family of grown children. Streisand is mom to Hason Gould, her son from her marriage to Elliot Gould.</p><p>James has three kids, Jess, Molly, and Josh Brolin, all from two previous marriages. However, the relationship that stands out the most in their family is the one between Thanos actor Josh and Streisand.</p><p>The warm family love also extends to Josh’s wife, Katherine Boyd, and his children. It is safe to say that the “The Way We Were” crooner and her stepson have been able to bond better because they are neighbors.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=josh-brolin-shows-streisand-affection><span class=ez-toc-section id=Josh_Brolin_Shows_Streisand_Affection></span>Josh Brolin Shows Streisand Affection<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Their home’s proximity has helped Josh and Streisand maintain a lovely rapport, but the duo does put in the extra effort as regards the novel coronavirus pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>The Streisand-Brolin family made it to the news when Josh visited his family amid the <a href=#>COVID-19 </a>pandemic. It caused some uproar on social media, and many thought it was inappropriate for Josh to visit his aged parents in the volatile period.</p><p>He had posted a photo on social media showing how he and his family members enjoyed time together. In the snapshot, the “Sicario: Day of the Soldado” star lounged by the poolside with other members of the family.</p><p>After going under fire, Josh <a href=#>took down the photo and issued an apolog</a>y. He also stated that he and his dad were neighbors, and the initial plan was to visit while social-distancing; however, the plan changed.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of the faux pas, Josh and his beloved stepmom found a creative way to show their love without flouting quarantine rules. The next day, Streisand displayed this on her Instagram page.</p><p>She <a href=#>shared two images </a>showing Boyd raising a cardboard sign decorated with pink ribbons; the sign read, “We [heart] you Gramma & Grampa.” Boyd also made sure to put up her swing from the clear glass outside Streisand’s home and protected herself with a nose mask.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=barbra-streisand-is-a-typical-grandmother><span class=ez-toc-section id=Barbra_Streisand_is_a_Typical_Grandmother></span>Barbra Streisand is a Typical Grandmother&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Streisand is a wholesome family woman who diligently carried out her duty as a stepmom and a grandmother. When she is not cheering Josh on his Hollywood milestones, she <a href=#>shows love to her little grandkids.&nbsp;</a></p><p>The famous grandmother once made headlines for her unwavering bond with Josh’s little girl, Westlyn Brolin, after Josh shared a photo of them on social media. The “Oldboy” actor’s post showed Streisand holding the little girl close to her bosom while posing for the camera.</p><p>The “Stoney End” crooner later took to her <a href=#>Instagram</a> page and posted the same snapshot. She gushed over Westlyn, describing her as the “most delicious thing.”&nbsp;</p><p>Before Westyln was born, Josh proved Streisand was <a href=#>the “typical Jewish grandmother.” </a>He recalled how his wife got the award-winning singer a bracelet with the word “grandma” engraved on it.</p><p>Josh noted that Streisand was filled with emotions as she started crying. He stated that she was one of “those… it’s annoying, but in a really great way” grandmother, who always called to check in and suggest names for the baby.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=updates-on-barbra-streisand-and-james-longtime-marriage><span class=ez-toc-section id=Updates_On_Barbra_Streisand_and_James_Longtime_Marriage></span>Updates On Barbra Streisand and James’ Longtime Marriage<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The pandemic and quarantine fostered closer bonds within families, Streisand’s family included. The family patriarch, James, confirmed that the period did do them some good.</p><p>He specifically talked about how he fell in love with his wife more amid the lockdown. James opened up about this while on “The Talk.” The “Amityville Horror” star <a href=#>shared</a>:</p><p>“We’ve literally fallen in love over this period of time, just being stuck together every day and making it work. 23 years is better than ever, I must say.”</p><p>He explained that he and Streisand always had a way to handle issues because they were “good at talking things out.” In addition, the “Marcus Welby, MD” actor, stated that their personalities were a perfect match.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kr6K%2BwauYZqukp7Kqv8Cnm2aZnpl6q7vSoWSbqp%2Bhtq95x5qtnmWRYsKvtdCunGaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBiwamt02aaqK2cmXqvu9NmmZ5lmJ67pbHRnptmmqliwamxjKmYp5yVorakew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-help-iran-protests.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Help Iran Protestors 2023: Women, Life &amp;amp; Freedom">&larr;

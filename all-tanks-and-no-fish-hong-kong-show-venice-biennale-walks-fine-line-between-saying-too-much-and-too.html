But there is life of a different kind in the tanks.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">South Korean artist and Loewe model on her 2024 Venice Biennale pavilion</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In one, a kind of marine algae has attached itself to a volcanic rock and it is thriving, its delicate fronds performing a mesmerising dance and having its time in the limelight.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Algae is an aquarist’s enemy. There are all sorts of products out there to help keep fish tanks pristine. But these incredible organisms produce oxygen and are a source of food for fish.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is a symbol of a natural ecosystem and the opposite of the kind of overweening and destructive intervention seen in Little Comfy Tornado.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Out in the courtyard, there are signs of a meddlesome aquarist reformed. Mx. Trying-My-Best (2024) is a group of construction waste bins with solar-powered water pumps attached. Among the rubble and discarded metal tools, lotuses introduced by Yeung are growing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Here, the pump action is barely visible, just enough to keep mosquitoes from breeding and to aerate these makeshift ponds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/25/85a94224-e107-4cea-8ccf-4cf2a16087d3_8d1e04f4.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An even subtler intervention is the creation of two impromptu greenhouses. The team had brought over spare glass tanks in case of breakage, and Yeung has placed two of them over a patch of weed that is growing through a crack in the concrete-covered ground, and a pile of rubble with no visible sign of life, yet. It will be interesting to see what is growing inside them in a few months’ time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yeung, who is also a keen horticulturist, tends to caution against the treatment of plants and fish in his works simply as metaphor, just as a painter would wish viewers to look beyond iconography. But there is always the sense that nature points the way (even if through gentle nudging by the artist).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And so, in the first room, we see a lovely example of humans exhibiting the same adaptability and stubbornness as the lotus and the algae.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Two Unwanted Lovers (2024), an assemblage of used tables, used office cabinets and aquarium paraphernalia, is a work that doubles as the reception area for the exhibition.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The two tables salvaged in Hong Kong are mismatched yet familiar. The wooden table and the metal office desk are the durable kinds favoured by security guards in Hong Kong buildings. A photo of pet piranhas is stuck on the metal table top – just like the way security guards or bus station masters personalise found furniture to reshape their very public work spaces in their idea of home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/25/6cb167e7-862a-4da3-b30d-701de9bdfc6c_812028c5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These are acts that blur the private and the public and subvert the very basis of an ultra-capitalist society such as Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Behind the member of staff stationed at the desks, a cabinet door is deliberately left open to reveal one of Yeung’s signature mushroom-shaped night lights. Called Night Mushroom in shade (Teak Cabinet) (2024), its gentle, pastel glow summons the viewer to transgress, to take a step into that forbidden zone behind the front desk.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yeung never directly discusses links between his work and today’s Hong Kong, but the city is very much present here, beyond physical reminders such as the replica of the tropical fish shops in Mong Kok’s “Goldfish Street”. (A bare metal frame with empty tubes of water hanging from it is another element taken from the shops, laying bare our insatiable appetite for commoditised lives.)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The empty tanks bring to mind the wave of emigration after 2019 and the city’s low birth rate. And Little Comfy Tornado reflects the rapid introduction of new laws, red lines and methods of control that are causing unease in Hong Kong while the government issues repeated reassurances that they are driven by a utopian vision – the pristine fish tank sitting on top.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If that is a nod to troubles at home, the lotus, the algae and the front desks serve to liberate the meaning of home from one that is closed and exclusive.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">This Chinese illustrator is healing people through her art</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More broadly, Yeung has a habit of emancipating meanings locked inside the mundane and celebrating personal attachments and memories as a way to defy conventional value systems.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The exhibition title, “Courtyard of Attachments”, alludes to the role of attachments that we form with people and things that are utterly personal, defy distinctions between private and public and are often incomprehensible to others.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That rather unsightly water fountain in the courtyard is the opposite of the grand, baroque fountains seen in old European cities such as Venice but it is a monument nonetheless: it is based on the fish tanks used by Yeung’s father when he owned a seafood restaurant in Shenzhen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Across the border from Hong Kong, it is a place where Yeung used to spend a lot of time when he was a child. Here, too, is a nod to diasporic experiences and a sense of alienation that echoes the Venice Biennale’s theme this year of “Foreigners Everywhere”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yeung used to put his beloved fish in his work. Live in Hong Kong, Born in Dongguan (2015), shown in the exhibition “A Hundred Years Of Shame – Songs of Resistance and Scenarios for Chinese Nations” at Hong Kong art space Para Site, featured six kinds of fish that had to be kept in very different kinds of environments, a symbol of how he felt like a fish out of water when he first moved with his family from mainland China to Hong Kong as a boy.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Got any of your pet’s fur to spare? This Hong Kong artist wants it</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When asked about the conspicuous absence of fish in this and other recent exhibitions, Yeung says he does not want them to become a distraction as he creates situations that invite the audience to consider the systems and power structures that control our world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">How has this highly nuanced exhibition gone down?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I think the messages are far too muffled for the Venice crowd as they try to see as many of the more than 100 shows as possible in a limited time. But for someone from Hong Kong, I feel there is too much to take in.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are excesses such as Rolling Gold Fountain (2024), a stripped-down version of a common feng shui device and a brilliant deconstruction of human folly, that seems to go off on a tangent and should have been edited out.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Yeung is an artist intent on upsetting conventions – and as his Instagram handle, @plantertrevor, denotes – his loyalty is with the plants.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Trevor Yeung: Courtyard of Attachments”, Hong Kong in Venice, Campo della Tana, Castello 2126, 30122, Venice.

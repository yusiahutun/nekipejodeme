After working with the professional baseball team of the New York Mets, his ATHLEAN-X program, videos and other materials have sparked great interest among people who want to build their bodies. Here you will find everything you need to know about him.</p><h2><strong>Who Is Jeff Cavaliere? His Age</strong></h2><p>Jeff Cavaliere was born on 28 June 1975 in Connecticut, in the United States. He also grew up there. Since he has hardly any information about his family members, it is known that he has been interested in bodybuilding since his childhood and admires people like Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and many others he has seen in movies.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is Barbara Dunkelman Dating As Boyfriend? Her Height, Age</a></strong></p><p>When he grew up, his father helped him repair a heavy bag in the basement where he learned to box. Interestingly, he had posters of Sylvester Stallone, who was his main idol, hanging on the wall, which served as motivation while he worked on his athletic appearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Jeff-Cavaliere.jpg><p>For his education, while still in high school, he began to play various sports such as football, baseball, and weightlifting. When he finished, he transferred to the University of Connecticut where he earned a Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.Sc.), Physioneurobiology. After graduation, he remained at the university and received a master’s degree in physical therapy.</p><h2><strong>Career, ATHLEAN-X Program</strong></h2><p>As soon as he finished his training, he started writing for Men’s Fitness in 2004, and he continues to write until 2018. He has also worked with the New York Mets Major League as a senior physical therapist and assistant strength trainer. He did this from 2006 to 2009, when he left the league.</p><p>In 2009, he founded ATHLEAN-X, a company dedicated to producing sports medicine that helps athletes achieve a good physique and others who want to look like athletes. He also has the so-called ATHLEAN-X program. Through it, he gets help and training for athletes and bodybuilders.</p><p>Jeff Cavaliere has a training guide that focuses on four main areas and aims to give athletes better flexibility and strength. According to him, he has designed his program to avoid overstraining, which he believes is the problem in most training.</p><p>He has become very well known and respected in social media, where he has a large fan base. On Instagram, he has nearly 700,000 followers, while his YouTube channel, which has over 5 million subscribers, has been viewed nearly a billion times. He also has a good fan base on other social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Chris Froome Wife, Family, Height, Weight, Body, Doping Scandal</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Jeff Cavaliere </strong><strong>Family, Wife</strong></h2><figure id=attachment_25716 class="wp-caption aligncenter amp-wp-inline-086b83d24e4412010a175ea3dba11ca3" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-25716></figure><p>Although not much is known about his family, it is clear that his father offered him a lot of support when he started bodybuilding as a child and he was very close to his grandmother. He lost his mother when she was 57 years old, to cancer.</p><p>In case you are wondering, he is a married man. He has managed to keep all information about his wife, to whom he has been married since 2008, out of public view, although she can be seen in a number of his videos. In 2016, Jeff and his wife gave birth to twins, and the children can also be seen in some of his videos, and their pictures are distributed by him on social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Jeff-Cavaliere-and-his-sons.jpg><p>When he married, he was still on the New York Mets, but then he decided to leave the team to spend more time with his family.</p><h2><strong>Height And Weight</strong></h2><p>As a bodybuilder and coach, one of the first things you notice when you see Jeff is his body structure. However, in many meetings, he may not be the tallest, because he is only average in size, even if he can pass as the most built.</p><p>He has a height of 172.5 cm (5 feet) and a bodyweight of 83.9 – 88.5 kg (185 – 195 lbs). Because of his stature, there are people on the Internet who have constantly asked if he is taking steroids. All the signs suggest that he is not taking steroids because his training and other activities seem to be the only things he relies on besides a diet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kxKm7jKKqZqKVm7Nur8CvmKWhlaeybrTIrGSan5Vitaa1xqGrZq%2BZm7JussCmoKWxXZbBqbjEmqVmsF2lv7Cz0ZqkaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jussie-smollett.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jussie Smollett dating?

Crawford and Westwick, meanwhile, have been living together in their Manhattan apartment since 2007. The fact that they shared a house added fuel to the fire. Westwick, on the other hand, left the apartment in 2009.</p><h2>Is Chace Crawford a gay man?</h2><p>Crawford was previously connected to former NSYNC singer JC Chasez before being linked to Westwick.&nbsp;The actor’s publicist, on the other hand, dismissed the LGBT accusations in his message, calling the never-ending rumors “totally incorrect.”&nbsp;Similarly, Crawford shrugged aside speculations about his sexual orientation during his conversation with Metro. He jokingly said that an actor couldn’t be successful until he became mired in homosexual rumors.&nbsp;Furthermore, the former model stated that he was not participating in a covert affair with the singer.</p><p>Chasez, on the other hand, labeled the homosexual allegations “annoying” during his performance on Randy Jackson Presents America’s Best Dance Crew’s live finale. The artist emphasized how the homosexual guesses were amusing the first time but became tiresome after the tenth. According to Chase, People were free to make assumptions. However, he said that making up bogus tales and lying overtly would be unacceptable. Furthermore, the pop artist did not hold back when it came to addressing sexuality accusations. He said that he was heterosexual and that he was entitled to have same-sex pals.</p><h2>What Is Chace Crawford’s Relationship Status?</h2><p>A glance at the Gossip Girl star’s dating history reveals three well-known names.&nbsp;Crawford’s girlfriend was said to be actress Rebecca Rittenhouse in July 2015. They initially met on the set of their television program, Blood and Oil.&nbsp;The romance allegations gained traction when the actress was photographed with Crawford at the London Hotel in West Hollywood, California, offering her companionship during Crawford’s birthday party celebration.</p><p>However, it was announced in late 2018 that they had decided to break up. Crawford acknowledged he was single following a recent separation during an interview with US magazine on April 29, 2019, during the Tribeca Film Festival’s screening of The Boys in New York.&nbsp;“I’ve been dating around a little bit, but nothing serious,” the actor said, without going into any detail about his current romance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Chace-Crawford-1.jpg><p>Surprisingly, Crawford was spotted walking with his ex-girlfriend in Los Feliz, California, the following March. His public appearance with Rittenhouse fueled talks of a reunion. And the suspicion was validated when the couple spent their July 2021 vacation in Capri, Italy. Initially, the actor and actress were spotted on a boat enjoying a sunny day. They afterward went for a stroll along the beach. During the walk, Rittenhouse was spotted wearing brightly colored shorts and a top over her jade green swimsuit. Crawford dressed down with a plain grey T-shirt, orange shorts, and black sunglasses. Prior to Rittenhouse, the actor’s girlfriend was renowned singer Carrie Underwood from 2007 and 2008. Crawford was also said to have dated model Rachelle Goulding from 2013 to 2014.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Chace Crawford</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Rittenhouse</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaoZmTmnqkvsCwnaiqlGK%2FtrnOq5ydZaSkeqOxjKCYsmWTlrqmec6uq2aZo2KubrLApaqeZ1xheW14i2U%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./donedaphne-zuniga.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Daphne Zuniga Bio, Husband, Children, Instagram, and Net worth">&larr;

Despite his many iconic roles in The Batman, Tenet, and The Devil All The Time, Robert Pattinson is best known for playing Edward Cullen in the supernatural romance fantasy film series Twilight. The actor is set to have a baby soon with his partner Suki Waterhouse. But his fans joked they were recently traumatized by ‘<a href=#>Twilight flashbacks upon hearing his baby news</a>.’ Although Twilight has a massive fan base it is also a ginormous hater base. What’s more? The film’s lead Robert seems to be among the latter. We take a look at all the times he expressed his true feelings about Twilight by slagging off the <a href=#>movie</a> franchise.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-83524103-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robert-pattinson-s-brutally-honest-thoughts-about-twilight>Robert Pattinson’s brutally honest thoughts about Twilight</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-said-he-got-his-dignity-back-when-the-film-series-ended>He said he got his dignity back when the film series ended</h3><p>When asked if he took anything home from the set of the last Twilight movie, Robert Pattinson said his “dignity.” In another interview with Moviefone, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> he would “mindlessly hate” the movie series if he wasn’t in it.</p><p>“I think I am a judgmental and cynical person who would just mindlessly hate it without having seen anything; I just think I’m a bad person,” the 35-year-old said at the time.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-compared-edward-to-an-axe-murderer>He compared Edward to an axe murderer</h3><p>Talking to OK magazine, he once <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a> how a guy like Edward would have been an axe murderer if someone met him in reality.</p><p>He joked: “You always get weirdos like Edward who seem to attract women for some reason. If Edward wasn’t a fictional character and you met him in reality, he is like one of those guys who would probably be an axe murderer or something.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robert-said-twilight-should-never-have-been-published>Robert said&nbsp;Twilight&nbsp;should never have been published</h3><p>In an interview with&nbsp;E!&nbsp;(as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">per</a> Coming Soon) the Harry Potter actor revealed what he felt about the books when he first read them. He also claimed the book should never have been published. Robert said it was like reading a “sexual fantasy.”</p><p>“When I read it, I was convinced Stephenie was convinced she was Bella and it was like it was a book that wasn’t supposed to be published. It was like reading her sexual fantasy, especially when she said it was based on a dream” he expressed.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-said-the-plot-doesn-t-make-sense>He said the plot doesn’t make sense</h3><p>Along the same lines, he also expressed how the plot of the story makes no sense whatsoever.</p><p>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Chris Van Vilet</a>, Robert said: “There’s a lot of stuff in the Twilight world that doesn’t make sense. It’s like, why are they still going to high school? Like, up until last year? They’re a hundred years old.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-slammed-bella-and-edward-s-age-difference>He slammed Bella and Edward’s age difference</h3><p>The British actor was among the many fans who pointed out the unnatural age difference between the Twilight leads Bella (played by Kristen Stewart) and Edward. He said: “What am I doing with this kid? I’m 108 years old.”</p><p>He also pointed out how the character’s behavior did not make sense. The Teen Choice Award winner notes how Edward keeps telling Bella he feels the urge to kill her all the time.</p><p>Instead of running a mile, she says: “I don’t care. I love you.’ And it’s like, well, there’s something wrong with her and there’s something wrong with me.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-ran-out-of-the-nbsp-twilight-nbsp-premiere>He ran out of the Twilight premiere</h3><p>If you could not sit through the Twilight movies, you aren’t the only one. Robert once revealed how he wasn’t able to watch the film at the premiere because he thought it was too much.</p><p>He said on a commentary on the film: “I think this is where I can’t handle it anymore. In the premiere.” To escape the “nightmare” story, he ran out of the theater.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robert-thinks-it-s-strange-that-people-like-twilight>Robert thinks it’s strange that people like Twilight</h3><p>Although Twilight ended in 2012, in his 2020 interview with Variety, the actor shared his thoughts on the film series once again.</p><p>He expressed how he thought it was strange the book and subsequent films have such a big fan base.</p><p>The Remember Me star said: “It’s a weird story,&nbsp;Twilight.&nbsp;It’s not just like – it’s strange how people responded a lot to it. I guess the books are very romantic, but at the same time, it’s not like&nbsp;The Notebook&nbsp;romantic.”</p><p>He said how The Notebook is sweet and heartbreaking but Twilight in his own words is “about this guy, and he finds the one girl he wants to be with, and he also wants to eat her.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aCcIOMraCmnaNiv7CuxKurZqiRqcGqutKopWacmZm7tXnFoqOtnaJitaq%2FjK6loaGenLKledOhpq6fmKnAbrvVnqlmrKeeuaqzx61m</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./carlos-mencia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Carlos Mencia Net Worth, Wife, Children, Wiki, Bio &amp;amp; House">&larr;
